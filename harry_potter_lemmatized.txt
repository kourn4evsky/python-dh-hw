anything strange or mysterious because they just didn't hold with such nonsense mr dursley be the director of a firm call grunnings which make drill he be a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he do have a very large mustache mrs dursley be thin and blonde and have nearly twice the usual amount of neck which come in very useful as she spend so much of her time crane over garden fence spy on the neighbor the dursleys have a small son call dudley and in their opinion there be no finer boy anywhere the dursleys have everything they want but they also have a secret and their greatest fear be that somebody would discover it they didn't think they could bear it if anyone find out about the potter mrs potter be mrs dursley's sister but they hadn't meet for several years in fact mrs dursley pretend she didn't have a sister because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband be as undursleyish as it be possible to be the dursleys shudder to think what the neighbor would say if the potter arrive in the street the dursleys know that the potter have a small son too but they have never even see him this boy be another good reason for keep the potter away they didn't want dudley mix with a child like that when mr and mrs dursley wake up on the dull gray tuesday our story start there be nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happen all over the country mr dursley hum as he pick out his most bore tie for work and mrs dursley gossip away happily as she wrestle a scream dudley into his high chair none of them notice a large tawny owl flutter past the window at half past eight mr dursley pick up his briefcase peck mrs dursley on the cheek and try to kiss dudley good-bye but miss because dudley be now have a tantrum and throw his cereal at the wall little tyke chortle mr dursley as he leave the house he get into his car and back out of number four's drive it be on the corner of the street that he notice the first sign of something peculiar—a cat read a map for a second mr dursley didn't realize what he have seen—then he jerk his head around to look again there be a tabby cat stand on the corner of privet drive but there wasn't a map in sight what could he have be think of it must have be a trick of the light mr dursley blink and star at the cat it star back as mr dursley drive around the corner and up the road he watch the cat in his mirror it be now read the sign that say privet drive—no look at the sign cat couldn't read map or sign mr dursley give himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drive toward town he think of nothing except a large order of drill he be hop to get that day but on the edge of town drill be drive out of his mind by something else as he sit in the usual morning traffic jam he couldn't help notice that there seem to be a lot of strangely dress people about people in cloak mr dursley couldn't bear people who dress in funny clothes—the getups you saw on young people he suppose this be some stupid new fashion he drum his finger on the steer wheel and his eye fell on a huddle of these weirdos stand quite close by they be whisper excitedly together mr dursley be enrage to see that a couple of them weren't young at all why that man have to be older than he be and wear an emerald-green cloak the nerve of him but then it strike mr dursley that this be probably some silly stunt—these people be obviously collect for something yes that would be it the traffic move on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrive in the grunnings park lot his mind back on drill mr dursley always sit with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadn't he might have find it harder to concentrate on drill that morning he didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street do they point and gaze openmouthed as owl after owl speed overhead most of them have never see an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however have a perfectly normal owl-free morning he yell at five different people he make several important telephone call and shout a bite more he be in a very good mood until lunchtime when he think he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery he'd forget all about the people in cloak until he pass a group of them next to the baker's he eye them angrily as he pass he didn't know why but they make him uneasy this bunch be whisper excitedly too and he couldn't see a single collect tin it be on his way back past them clutch a large doughnut in a bag that he catch a few word of what they be say the potter that's right that's what i hear yes their son harry mr dursley stop dead fear flood him he look back at the whisperers as if he want to say something to them but think better of it he dash back across the road hurry up to his office snap at his secretary not to disturb him seize his telephone and have almost finish dial his home number when he change his mind he put the receiver back down and stroke his mustache think no he be be stupid potter wasn't such an unusual name he be sure there be lot of people call potter who have a son call harry come to think of it he wasn't even sure his nephew be call harry he'd never even see the boy it might have be harvey or harold there be no point in worry mrs dursley she always get so upset at any mention of her sister he didn't blame her—if he'd have a sister like that but all the same those people in cloak he find it a lot harder to concentrate on drill that afternoon and when he leave the build at five o'clock he be still so worry that he walk straight into someone just outside the door sorry he grunt as the tiny old man stumble and almost fell it be a few second before mr dursley realize that the man be wear a violet cloak he didn't seem at all upset at be almost knock to the grind on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he say in a squeaky voice that make passersby stare don't be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for you-know-who have go at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrate this happy happy day and the old man hug mr dursley around the middle and walk off mr dursley stand root to the spot he have be hug by a complete stranger he also think he have be call a muggle whatever that be he be rattle he hurry to his car and set off for home hop he be imagine things which he have never hop before because he didn't approve of imagination as he pull into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw—and it didn't improve his mood—was the tabby cat he'd spot that morning it be now sit on his garden wall he be sure it be the same one it have the same mark around its eye shoo say mr dursley loudly the cat didn't move it just give him a stern look be this normal cat behavior mr dursley wonder try to pull himself together he let himself into the house he be still determine not to mention anything to his wife mrs dursley have have a nice normal day she tell him over dinner all about mrs next door's problems with her daughter and how dudley have learn a new word won't mr dursley try to act normally when dudley have be put to bed he go into the live room in time to catch the last report on the even news and finally bird-watchers everywhere have report that the nation's owls have be behave very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and be hardly ever see in daylight there have be hundreds of sight of these bird fly in every direction since sunrise experts be unable to explain why the owls have suddenly change their sleep pattern the newscaster allow himself a grin most mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather go to be any more shower of owls tonight jim well ted say the weatherman i don't know about that but it's not only the owls that have be act oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have be phone in to tell me that instead of the rain i promise yesterday they've have a downpour of shoot star perhaps people have be celebrate bonfire night early—it's not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sit freeze in his armchair shoot star all over britain owls fly by daylight mysterious people in cloak all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the potter mrs dursley come into the live room carry two cup of tea it be no good he'd have to say something to her he clear his throat nervously er—petunia dear—you haven't hear from your sister lately have you as he have expect mrs dursley look shock and angry after all they normally pretend she didn't have a sister no she say sharply why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumble owls shoot star and there be a lot of funny-looking people in town today so snap mrs dursley well i just think maybe it be something to do with you know her crowd mrs dursley sip her tea through purse lips mr dursley wonder whether he dare tell her he'd hear the name potter he decide he didn't dare instead he say as casually as he could their son—he'd be about dudley's age now wouldn't he i suppose so say mrs dursley stiffly what's his name again howard isn't it harry nasty common name if you ask me oh yes say mr dursley his heart sink horribly yes i quite agree he didn't say another word on the subject as they go upstairs to bed while mrs dursley be in the bathroom mr dursley creep to the bedroom window and peer down into the front garden the cat be still there it be star down privet drive as though it be wait for something be he imagine things could all this have anything to do with the potter if it do if it get out that they be relate to a pair of—well he didn't think he could bear it the dursleys get into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turn it all over in his mind his last comfort think before he fell asleep be that even if the potter be involve there be no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potter know very well what he and petunia think about them and their kind he couldn't see how he and petunia could get mix up in anything that might be go on—he yawn and turn over—it couldn't affect them how very wrong he be mr dursley might have be drift into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside be show no sign of sleepiness it be sit as still as a statue its eye fix unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didn't so much as quiver when a car door slam on the next street nor when two owls swoop overhead in fact it be nearly midnight before the cat move at all a man appear on the corner the cat have be watch appear so suddenly and silently you'd have think he'd just pop out of the grind the cat's tail twitch and its eye narrow nothing like this man have ever be see on privet drive he be tall thin and very old judge by the silver of his hair and beard which be both long enough to tuck into his belt he be wear long rob a purple cloak that sweep the grind and high-heeled buckle boot his blue eye be light bright and sparkle behind half-moon spectacles and his nose be very long and crook as though it have be break at least twice this man's name be albus dumbledore albus dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he have just arrive in a street where everything from his name to his boot be unwelcome he be busy rummage in his cloak look for something but he do seem to realize he be be watch because he look up suddenly at the cat which be still star at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seem to amuse him he chuckle and mutter i should have know he find what he be look for in his inside pocket it seem to be a silver cigarette lighter he flick it open hold it up in the air and click it the nearest street lamp go out with a little pop he click it again—the next lamp flicker into darkness twelve time he click the put-outer until the only light leave on the whole street be two tiny pinpricks in the distance which be the eye of the cat watch him if anyone look out of their window now even beady-eyed mrs dursley they wouldn't be able to see anything that be happen down on the pavement dumbledore slip the put-outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sit down on the wall next to the cat he didn't look at it but after a moment he speak to it fancy see you here professor mcgonagall he turn to smile at the tabby but it have go instead he be smile at a rather severe-looking woman who be wear square glass exactly the shape of the mark the cat have have around its eye she too be wear a cloak an emerald one her black hair be draw into a tight bun she look distinctly ruffle how do you know it be me she ask my dear professor i ve never see a cat sit so stiffly you'd be stiff if you'd be sit on a brick wall all day say professor mcgonagall all day when you could have be celebrate i must have pass a dozen feast and party on my way here professor mcgonagall sniff angrily oh yes everyone's celebrate all right she say impatiently you'd think they'd be a bite more careful but no—even the muggles have notice something's go on it be on their news she jerk her head back at the dursleys dark living-room window i hear it flock of owls shoot star well they're not completely stupid they be bind to notice something shoot star down in kent—i'll bet that be dedalus diggle he never have much sense you can't blame them say dumbledore gently we've have precious little to celebrate for eleven years i know that say professor mcgonagall irritably but that's no reason to lose our head people be be downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dress in muggle clothe swap rumor she throw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hop he be go to tell her something but he didn't so she go on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknow-who seem to have disappear at last the muggles find out about us all i suppose he really have go dumbledore it certainly seem so say dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop they're a kind of muggle sweet i'm rather fond of no thank you say professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didn't think this be the moment for lemon drop as i say even if you-know-who have go  my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this youknow-who nonsense—for eleven years i have be try to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinch but dumbledore who be unsticking two lemon drop seem not to notice it all get so confuse if we keep say you-know-who  i have never see any reason to be frighten of say voldemort's name i know you haven t say professor mcgonagall sound half exasperate half admire but you're different everyone know you're the only one you-knowoh all right voldemort be frighten of you flatter me say dumbledore calmly voldemort have power i will never have only because you're too—well—noble to use them it's lucky it's dark i haven't blush so much since madam pomfrey tell me she like my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shoot a sharp look at dumbledore and say the owls be nothing next to the rumor that be fly around you know what everyone's say about why he's disappear about what finally stop him it seem that professor mcgonagall have reach the point she be most anxious to discuss the real reason she have be wait on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman have she fix dumbledore with such a pierce stare as she do now it be plain that whatever everyone be say she be not go to believe it until dumbledore tell her it be true dumbledore however be choose another lemon drop and do not answer what they're say she press on be that last night voldemort turn up in godric's hollow he go to find the potter the rumor be that lily and jam potter are—are—that they're—dead  dumbledore bow his head professor mcgonagall gasp lily and jam i can't believe it i didn't want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reach out and pat her on the shoulder i know i know he say heavily professor mcgonagall's voice tremble as she go on that's not all they're say he try to kill the potter's son harry but—he couldn't he couldn't kill that little boy no one know why or how but they're say that when he couldn't kill harry potter voldemort's power somehow broke—and that's why he's go dumbledore nod glumly it's—it's true falter professor mcgonagall after all he's do all the people he's kill he couldn't kill a little boy it's just astound of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven do harry survive we can only guess say dumbledore we may never know professor mcgonagall pull out a lace handkerchief and dab at her eye beneath her spectacles dumbledore give a great sniff as he take a golden watch from his pocket and examine it it be a very odd watch it have twelve hand but no number instead little planets be move around the edge it must have make sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and say hagrid's late i suppose it be he who tell you i'd be here by the way yes say professor mcgonagall and i don't suppose you're go to tell me why you're here of all place i've come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle they're the only family he have leave now you don't mean—you can't mean the people who live here cry professor mcgonagall jump to her feet and point at number four dumbledore—you can't i've be watch them all day you couldn't find two people who be less like us and they've get this son—i saw him kick his mother all the way up the street scream for sweets harry potter come and live here it's the best place for him say dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older i've write them a letter a letter repeat professor mcgonagall faintly sit back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him he'll be famous—a legend—i wouldn't be surprise if today be know as harry potter day in the future—there will be book write about harry—every child in our world will know his name exactly say dumbledore look very seriously over the top of his half-moon glass it would be enough to turn any boy's head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he won't even remember cara you see how much better off he'll be grow up away from all that until he's ready to take it professor mcgonagall open her mouth change her mind swallow and then say yes—yes you're right of course but how be the boy get here dumbledore she eye his cloak suddenly as though she think he might be hide harry underneath it hagrid's bring him you think it—wise—to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life say dumbledore i'm not say his heart isn't in the right place say professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you can't pretend he's not careless he do tend to—what be that a low rumble sound have break the silence around them it grow steadily louder as they look up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swell to a roar as they both look up at the sky—and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and land on the road in front of them if the motorcycle be huge it be nothing to the man sit astride it he be almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five time as wide he look simply too big to be allow and so wild—long tangle of bushy black hair and beard hide most of his face he have hand the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boot be like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arm he be hold a bundle of blanket hagrid say dumbledore sound relieve at last and where do you get that motorcycle borrow it professor dumbledore sit say the giant climb carefully off the motorcycle as he speak young sirius black lend it to me i've get him sir no problems be there no sir—house be almost destroy but i get him out all right before the muggles start swarmin around he fell asleep as we be flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bend forward over the bundle of blanket inside just visible be a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shape cut like a bolt of lightning be that where  whisper professor mcgonagall yes say dumbledore he'll have that scar forever couldn't you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldn't scar can come in handy i have one myself above my leave knee that be a perfect map of the london underground well—give him here hagrid—we'd better get this over with dumbledore take harry in his arm and turn toward the dursleys house could i—could i say good-bye to him sir ask hagrid he bend his great shaggy head over harry and give him what must have be a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wound dog shhh hiss professor mcgonagall you'll wake the muggles s-s-sorry sob hagrid take out a large spot handkerchief and bury his face in it but i c-c-can't stand it—lily an jam dead—an poor little harry off ter live with muggles  yes yes it's all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or we'll be find professor mcgonagall whisper pat hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore step over the low garden wall and walk to the front door he lay harry gently on the doorstep take a letter out of his cloak tuck it inside harry's blanket and then come back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stand and look at the little bundle hagrid's shoulder shake professor mcgonagall blink furiously and the twinkle light that usually shine from dumbledore's eye seem to have go out well say dumbledore finally that's that we've no business stay here we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah say hagrid in a very muffle voice i'll be takin sirius his bike back g'night professor mcgonagall—professor dumbledore sir wipe his stream eye on his jacket sleeve hagrid swing himself onto the motorcycle and kick the engine into life with a roar it rise into the air and off into the night i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall say dumbledore nod to her professor mcgonagall blow her nose in reply dumbledore turn and walk back down the street on the corner he stop and take out the silver put-outer he click it once and twelve ball of light speed back to their street lamps so that privet drive glow suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slink around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blanket on the step of number four good luck harry he murmur he turn on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he be go a breeze ruffle the neat hedge of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonish things to happen harry potter roll over inside his blanket without wake up one small hand close on the letter beside him and he sleep on not know he be special not know he be famous not know he would be wake in a few hours time by mrs dursley's scream as she open the front door to put out the milk bottle nor that he would spend the next few weeks be prod and pinch by his cousin dudley he couldn't know that at this very moment people meet in secret all over the country be hold up their glass and say in hush voice to harry potter—the boy who live chapter two the vanish glass nearly ten years have pass since the dursleys have wake up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive have hardly change at all the sun rise on the same tidy front garden and light up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it creep into their live room which be almost exactly the same as it have be on the night when mr dursley have see that fateful news report about the owls only the photograph on the mantelpiece really show how much time have pass ten years ago there have be lot of picture of what look like a large pink beach ball wear different-colored bonnets—but dudley dursley be no longer a baby and now the photograph show a large blond boy rid his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair play a computer game with his father be hug and kiss by his mother the room hold no sign at all that another boy live in the house too yet harry potter be still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia be awake and it be her shrill voice that make the first noise of the day up get up now harry wake with a start his aunt rap on the door again up she screech harry hear her walk toward the kitchen and then the sound of the fry pan be put on the stave he roll onto his back and try to remember the dream he have be

look as though dudley have get the new computer he want not to mention the second television and the race bike exactly why dudley want a race bike be a mystery to harry as dudley be very fat and hat exercise—unless of course it involve punch somebody dudley's favorite punch bag be harry but he couldn't often catch him harry didn't look it but he be very fast perhaps it have something to do with live in a dark cupboard but harry have always be small and skinny for his age he look even smaller and skinnier than he really be because all he have to wear be old clothe of dudley's and dudley be about four time bigger than he be harry have a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eye he wear round glass hold together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the time dudley have punch him on the nose the only thing harry like about his own appearance be a very thin scar on his forehead that be shape like a bolt of lightning he have have it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember ask his aunt petunia be how he have get it in the car crash when your parent die she have say and don't ask question don't ask questions—that be the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys uncle vernon enter the kitchen as harry be turn over the bacon comb your hair he bark by way of a morning greet about once a week uncle vernon look over the top of his newspaper and shout that harry need a haircut harry must have have more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it make no difference his hair simply grow that way—all over the place harry be fry egg by the time dudley arrive in the kitchen with his mother dudley look a lot like uncle vernon he have a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eye and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often say that dudley look like a baby angel—harry often say that dudley look like a pig in a wig harry put the plat of egg and bacon on the table which be difficult as there wasn't much room dudley meanwhile be count his present his face fell thirty-six he say look up at his mother and father that's two less than last year darling you haven't count auntie marge's present see it's here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirty-seven then say dudley go red in the face harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum come on

dudley sit down heavily and grab the nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckle little tyke want his money's worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffle dudley's hair at that moment the telephone ring and aunt petunia go to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watch dudley unwrap the race bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer game and a vcr he be rip the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia come back from the telephone look both angry and worry bad news vernon she say mrs figg's break her leg she can't take him she jerk her head in

restaurants or the movies every year harry be leave behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who live two streets away harry hat it there the whole house smell of cabbage and mrs figg make him look at photograph of all the cat she'd ever own now what say aunt petunia look furiously at harry as though he'd plan this harry know he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg have break her leg but it wasn't easy when he remind himself it would be a whole year before he have to look at tibbles snowy mr paw and tufty again we could phone marge uncle vernon suggest don't be silly vernon she hat the boy the dursleys often speak about harry like this as though he wasn't there—or rather as though he be something very nasty that couldn't understand them like a slug what about what's-her-name your friend—yvonne on vacation in majorca snap aunt petunia you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully he'd be able to watch what he want on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudley's computer aunt petunia look as though she'd just swallow a lemon and come back and find the house in ruin she snarl i won't blow up the house say harry but they weren't listen i suppose we could take him to the zoo say aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car that car's new he's not sit in it alone dudley begin to cry loudly in fact he wasn't really crying—it have be years since

arm around him i don't want him t-t-to come dudley yell between huge pretend sob he always spspoils everything he shoot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arm just then the doorbell rang—»oh good lord they're here say aunt petunia frantically—and a moment later dudley's best friend piers polkiss walk in with his mother piers be a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he be usually the one who hold people's arm behind their back while dudley hit them dudley stop pretend to cry at once half an hour later harry who couldn't believe his luck be sit in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadn't be able to think of anything else to do with him but before they'd leave uncle vernon have take harry aside i'm warn you he have say put his large purple face right up close to harry's i'm warn you now boy—any funny business anything at all—and you'll be in that cupboard from now until christmas i'm not go to do anything say harry honestly but uncle vernon didn't believe him no one ever do the problem be strange things often happen around harry and it be just no good tell the dursleys he didn't make them happen once aunt petunia tire of harry come back from the barber look as though he hadn't be at all have take a pair of kitchen scissor and cut his hair so short he be almost bald except for his bang which she leave to hide that horrible scar dudley have laugh himself silly at harry who spend a sleepless night imagine school the next day where he be already laugh at for his baggy clothe and tap glass next morning however he have get up to find his hair exactly as it have be before aunt petunia have shear it off he have be give a week in his cupboard for this even though he have try to explain that he couldn't explain how it have grow back so quickly another time aunt petunia have be try to force him into a revolt old sweater of dudley's brown with orange puff balls)—the harder she try to pull it over his head the smaller it seem to become until finally it might have fit a hand puppet but certainly wouldn't fit harry aunt petunia have decide it must have shrink in the wash and to his great relief harry wasn't punish on the other hand he'd get into terrible trouble for be find on the roof of the school kitchens dudley's gang have be chase him as usual when as much to harry's surprise as anyone else's there he be sit on the chimney the dursleys have receive a very angry letter from harry's headmistress tell them harry have be climb school build but all he'd try to do as he shout at uncle vernon through the lock door of his cupboard be jump behind the big trash can outside the kitchen doors harry suppose that the wind must have catch him in midjump but today nothing be go to go wrong it be even worth be with dudley and piers to be spend the day somewhere that wasn't school his cupboard or mrs figg's cabbage-smelling live room while he drive uncle vernon complain to aunt petunia he like to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry be just a few of his favorite subject this morning it be

car in front he turn right around in his seat and yell at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycle don't fly dudley and piers snigger i know they don't say harry it be only a dream but he wish he hadn't say anything if there be one thing the dursleys hat even more than his ask question it be his talk about anything act in a way it shouldn't no matter if it be in a dream or even a cartoon—they seem to think he might get dangerous ideas it be a very sunny saturday and the zoo be crowd with families the dursleys buy dudley and piers large chocolate ice cream at the entrance and then because the smile lady in the van have ask harry what he want before they could hurry him away they buy him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasn't bad either harry think lick it as they watch a gorilla scratch its head who look remarkably like dudley except that it wasn't blond harry have the best morning he'd have in a long time he be careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who be start to get bore with the animals by lunchtime wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hit him they eat in the zoo restaurant and when dudley have a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon buy him another one and harry be allow to finish the first harry felt afterward that he should have know it be all too good to last after lunch they go to the reptile house it be cool and dark in there with light windows all along the wall behind the glass all sort of lizards and snake be crawl and slither over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers want to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man-crushing pythons dudley quickly find the largest snake in the place it could have wrap its body twice around uncle vernon's car and crush it into a trash can—but at the moment it didn't look in the mood in fact it be fast asleep dudley stand with his nose press against the glass star at the glisten brown coil make it move he whine at his father uncle vernon tap on the glass but the snake didn't budge do it again dudley order uncle vernon rap the glass smartly with his knuckle but the snake just snooze on this be bore dudley moan he shuffle away harry move in front of the tank and look intently at the snake he wouldn't have be surprise if it have die of boredom itself—no company except stupid people drum their finger on the glass try to disturb it all day long it be worse than have a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor be aunt petunia hammer on the door to wake you up at least he get to visit the rest of the house the snake suddenly open its beady eye slowly very slowly it raise its head until its eye be on a level with harry's it wink harry star then he look quickly around to see if anyone be watch they weren't he look back at the snake and wink too the snake jerk its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raise its eye to the ceiling it give harry a look that say quite plainly i get that all the time i know harry murmur through the glass though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoy the snake nod vigorously where do you come from anyway harry ask the snake jab its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peer at it boa constrictor brazil be it nice there the boa constrictor jab its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen be breed in the zoo oh i see—so you've never be to brazil as the snake shake its head a deafen shout behind harry make both of them jump dudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you won't believe what it's do dudley come waddle toward them as fast as he could out of the way you he say punch harry in the rib catch by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what come next

boa constrictor's tank have vanish the great snake be uncoil itself rapidly slither out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house scream and start run for the exit as the snake slide swiftly past him harry could have swear a low hiss voice say brazil here i come thank amigo the keeper of the reptile house be in shock but the glass he keep say where do the glass go the zoo director himself make aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologize over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry have see the snake hadn't do anything except snap playfully at their heel as it pass but by the time they be all back in uncle vernon's car dudley be tell them how it have nearly bite off his leg while piers be swear it have try to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least be piers calm down enough to say harry be talk to it weren't you harry uncle vernon wait until piers be safely out of the house before start on harry he be so angry he could hardly speak he manage to say go—cupboard—stay—no meals before he collapse into a chair and aunt petunia have to run and get him a large brandy harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wish he have a

imagine where all the green light come from he couldn't remember his parent at all his aunt and uncle never speak about them and of course he be forbid to ask question there be no photograph of them in the house when he have be younger harry have dream and dream of some unknown relation come to take him away but it have never happen the dursleys be his only family yet sometimes he think or maybe

furiously if he know the man aunt petunia have rush them out of the shop without buy anything a wild-looking old woman dress all in green have wave merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat have actually shake his hand in the street the other day and then walk away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people be the way they seem to vanish the second harry try to get a closer look at school harry have no one everybody know that dudley's gang hat that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothe and break glass and nobody like to disagree with dudley's gang

strange wizards or witch terrible things happen he be takin over course some stand up to him—an he kill em horribly one o the only safe place leave be hogwarts reckon dumbledore's the only one you-know-who be afraid of didn't dare try takin the school not jus then anyway now yer mum an dad be as good a witch an wizard as i ever know head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day suppose the myst'ry be why you-know-who never try to get em on his side before probably know they be too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side maybe he think he could persuade em maybe he just want em outta the way all anyone know be he turn up in the village where you be all live on halloween ten years ago you be just a year old he come ter yer house an'—an  hagrid suddenly pull out a very dirty spot handkerchief and blow his nose with a sound like a foghorn sorry he say but it's that sad—knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldn't find—anyway you-know-who kill em an then—an this be the real myst'ry of the thing—he try to kill you too want ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just like killin by then but he couldn't do it never wonder how you get that mark on yer forehead that be no ordinary cut that's what yeh get when a powerful evil curse touch yeh—took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even—but it didn't work on you an that's why yer famous harry no one ever live after he decide ter kill em no one except you an he'd kill some o the best witch an wizards of the age—the mckinnons the bone the prewetts—an you be only a baby an you live something very painful be go on in harry's mind as hagrid's story come to a close he saw again the blind flash of green light more clearly than he have ever remember it before—and he remember something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh hagrid be watch him sadly take yeh from the ruin house myself on dumbledore's order bring yeh ter this lot load of old tosh say uncle vernon harry jump he have almost forget that the dursleys be there uncle vernon certainly seem to have get back his courage he be glare at hagrid and his fists be clench now you listen here boy he snarl i accept there's something strange about you probably nothing a good beat wouldn't have cured—and as for all this about your parent well they be weirdos no deny it and the world's better off without them in my opinion—asked for all they get get mix up with these wizarding types—just what i expect always know they'd come to a sticky end  but at that moment hagrid leap from the sofa and draw a batter pink umbrella from inside his coat point this at uncle vernon like a sword he say i'm warn you dursley i'm warn you—one more word  in danger of be spear on the end of an umbrella by a beard giant uncle vernon's courage fail again he flatten himself against the wall and fell silent that's better say hagrid breathe heavily and sit back down on the sofa which this time sag right down to the floor harry meanwhile still have question to ask hundreds of them but what happen to vol sorry—i mean you-know-who good question harry disappear vanish same night he try ter kill you make yeh even more famous that's the biggest myst'ry see he be gettin more an more powerful—why'd he go some say he die codswallop in my opinion dunno if he have enough human leave in him to die some say he's still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who be on his side come back ter ours some of em come outta kinda trance don reckon they could've do if he be comin back most of us

one does—but somethin about you stump him all right hagrid look at harry with warmth and respect blaze in his eye but harry instead of feel please and proud felt quite sure there have be a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be he'd spend his life be clout by dudley and bully by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he be really a wizard why hadn't they be turn into warty toads every time they'd try to lock him in his cupboard if he'd once defeat the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley have always be able to kick him around like a football hagrid he say quietly i think you must have make a mistake i don't think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckle not a wizard eh never make things happen when you be scar or angry harry look into the fire now he come to

yours thief you have be warn beware of find more than treasure there like i say yeh'd be mad ter try an rob it say hagrid a pair of goblins bow them through the silver doors and they be in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins be sit on high stool behind a long counter scribble in large ledgers weigh coin in brass scale examine precious stone through eyeglasses there be too many doors to count lead off the hall and yet more goblins be show people in and out of these hagrid and harry make for the counter morning say hagrid to a free goblin we've come ter take some money outta

passageway light with flame torch it slop steeply downward and there be little railway track on the floor griphook whistle and a small cart come hurtle up the track toward them they climb in—hagrid with some difficulty—and be off at first they just hurtle through a maze of twist passages harry try to remember leave right right leave middle fork right leave but it be impossible the rattle cart seem to know its own way because griphook wasn't steer harry's eye sting as the cold air rush past them but he keep them wide open once he think he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twist around to see if it be a dragon but too late they plunge even deeper pass an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grow from the ceiling and floor i never know harry call to hagrid over the noise of the cart what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmite's get an m in it say hagrid an don ask me question just now i think i'm gonna be sick he do

green smoke come billow out and as it clear harry gasp inside be mound of gold coin columns of silver heap of little bronze knuts all yours smile hagrid all harry's—it be incredible the dursleys

they be go even deeper now and gather speed the air become colder and colder as they hurtle round tight corner they go rattle over an underground ravine and harry lean over the side to try to see what be down at the dark bottom but hagrid groan and pull him back by the scruff of his neck vault seven hundred and thirteen have no keyhole stand back say griphook importantly he stroke the door gently with one of his long finger and it simply melt away if anyone but a gringotts goblin try that they'd be suck through the door and trap in there say griphook how often do you check to see if anyone's inside harry ask about once every ten years say griphook with a rather nasty grin something really extraordinary have to be inside this top security vault harry be sure and he lean forward eagerly expect to see fabulous jewel at the very least—but at first he think it be empty then he notice a grubby little package wrap up in brown paper lie on the floor hagrid pick it up and tuck it deep inside his coat harry long to know what it be but know better than to ask come on back in this infernal cart and don't talk to me on the way back it's best if i keep me mouth shut say hagrid one wild cart ride later they stand blink in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didn't know where to run first now that he have a bag full of money he didn't have to know how many galleons there be to a

step inside it be a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sit on to wait harry felt strangely as though he have enter a very strict library he swallow a lot of new question that have just occur to him and look instead at the thousands of narrow box pile neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickle the very dust and silence in here seem to tingle with some secret magic good afternoon say a soft voice harry jump hagrid must have jump too because there be a loud crunch noise and he get quickly off the spindly chair an old man be stand

ollivander wand have a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feather and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands be the same just as no two

of the seven players describe famous game he'd be to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he have the money he be just take harry through the finer point of the game when the compartment door slide open yet again but it wasn't neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time three boys enter and harry recognize the middle one at once it be the pale boy from madam malkin's robe shop he be look at harry with a lot more interest than he'd show back in diagon alley be it true he say they're say all down the train that harry potter's in this compartment so it's you

let out a horrible yell scabbers the rat be hang off his finger sharp little teeth sink deep into goyle's knuckle—crabbe and malfoy back away as goyle swing scabbers round and round howl and when scabbets finally fly off and hit the window all three of them disappear at once perhaps they think there be more rat lurk among the sweets or perhaps they'd hear footsteps because a second later hermione granger have come in what have be go on she say look at the sweets all over the floor and ron pick up scabbers by his tail i think he's be knock out ron say to harry he look closer at scabbers no—i don't believe it—he's go back to sleep and so he have you've meet malfoy before harry explain about their meet in diagon alley i've hear of his family say ron darkly they be some of the

dark tunnel which seem to be take them right underneath the castle until they reach a kind of underground harbor where they clamber out onto rock and pebbles oy you there be this your toad say hagrid who be check the boat as people climb out of them trevor cry neville blissfully hold out his hand then they clamber up a passageway in the rock after hagrid's lamp come out at last onto smooth damp

whole of the dursleys house in it the stone wall be light with flame torch like the ones at gringotts the ceiling be too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase face them lead to the upper floor they follow professor mcgonagall across the flag stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voice from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here—but professor mcgonagall show the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowd in stand rather closer together than they would usually have do peer about nervously welcome to hogwarts say professor mcgonagall the start-of-term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seat in the great hall you will be sort into your house the sort be a very important ceremony because while

mcgonagall please wait quietly she leave the chamber harry swallow how exactly do they sort us into house he ask ron some sort of test i think fred say it hurt a lot but i think he be joke harry's heart give a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didn't know any magic yet—what on earth would he have to do he hadn't expect something like this the moment they arrive he look around anxiously and saw that everyone else look terrify too no one be talk much except hermione granger who be whisper very fast about all the spell she'd learn and wonder which one she'd need harry try hard not to listen to her he'd never be more nervous never not even when he'd have to take a school report home to the dursleys say that he'd somehow turn his teacher's wig blue he keep his eye fix on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom then something happen that make him jump about a foot in the air—several people behind him scream what the  he gasp so do the people around him about twenty ghost have just stream through the back wall pearly-white and slightly transparent they glide across the room talk to one another and hardly glance at the first years they seem to be argue what look like a fat little monk be say forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance  my dear friar haven't we give peeve all the chance he deserve he give us all a bad name and you know he's not really even a ghost—i say what be you all do here a ghost wear a ruff and tights have suddenly notice the first years nobody answer new students say the fat friar smile around at them about to be sort i suppose a few people nod mutely hope to see you in hufflepuff say the friar my old house you know move along now say a sharp voice the sort ceremony's about to start professor mcgonagall have return one by one the ghost float away through the opposite wall now form a line professor mcgonagall tell the first years and follow me feel oddly as though his legs have turn to lead harry get into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walk out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall harry have never even imagine such a strange and splendid place it be light by thousands and thousands of candle that be float in midair over four long table where the rest of the students be sit these table be lay with glitter golden plat and goblets at the top of the hall be another long table where the teachers be sit professor mcgonagall lead the first years up here so that they come to a halt in a line face the other students with the teachers behind them the hundreds of face star at them look like pale lanterns in the flicker candlelight dot here and there among the students the ghost shine misty silver mainly to avoid all the star eye harry look upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dot with star he hear hermione whisper its bewitch to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a history it be hard to believe there be a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didn't simply open on to the heavens harry quickly look down again as professor mcgonagall silently place a four-legged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a point wizard's hat this hat be patch and fray and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldn't have let it in the house maybe they have to try and get a rabbit out of it harry think wildly that seem the sort of thing—noticing that everyone in the hall be now star at the hat he star at it too for a few second there be complete silence then the hat twitch a rip near the brim open wide like a mouth—and the hat begin to sing oh you may not think i'm pretty but don't judge on what you see i'll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me you can keep your bowlers black your top hat sleek and tall for i'm the hogwarts sort hat and i can cap them all there's nothing hide in your head the sort hat can't see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their dare nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they be just and loyal those patient hufflepuffis be true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if you've a ready mind where those of wit and learn will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin you'll make your real friends those cunning folk use any mean to achieve their end so put me on don't be afraid and don't get in a flap you're in safe hand though i have none for i'm a think cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finish its song it bow to each of the four table and then become quite still again so we've just get to try on the hat ron whisper to harry i'll kill fred he be go on about wrestle a troll harry smile weakly yes try on the hat be a lot better than have to do a spell but he do wish they could have try it on without everyone watch the hat seem to be ask rather alot harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment if only the hat have mention a house for people who felt a bite queasy that would have be the one for him professor mcgonagall now step forward hold a long roll of parchment when i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sort she say abbott hannah a pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumble out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eye and sit down a moments pause  hufflepuff shout the hat the table on the right cheer and clap as hannah go to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar wave merrily at her bone susan hufflepuff shout the hat again and susan scuttle off to sit next to hannah boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the leave clap this time several ravenclaws stand up to shake hand with terry as he join them  brocklehurst mandy go to ravenclaw too but brown lavender become the first new gryffindor and the table on the far leave explode with cheer harry could see ron's twin brothers catcall bulstrode millicent then become a slytherin perhaps it be harry's imagination after all he'd hear about slytherin but he think they look like an unpleasant lot he be start to feel definitely sick now he remember be pick for team during gym at his old school he have always be last to be choose not because he be no good but because no one want dudley to think they like him finch-fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry notice the hat shout out the house at once but at others it take a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandy-haired boy next to harry in the line sit on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declare him a gryffindor granger hermione hermione almost run to the stool and jam the hat eagerly on her head gryffindor shout the hat ron groan a horrible think strike harry as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous what if he wasn't choose at all what if he just sit there with the hat over his eye for age until professor mcgonagall jerk it off his head and say there have obviously be a mistake and he'd better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who keep lose his toad be call he fell over on his way to the stool the hat take a long time to decide with neville when it finally shout

the edge of the stool and think not slytherin not slytherin not slytherin eh say the small voice be you sure you could be great you know it's all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that—no well if you're sure—better be gryffindor harry hear the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he take off the hat and walk shakily toward the gryffindor table he be so relieve to have be choose and not put in slytherin he hardly notice that he be get the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect get up and shake his hand vigorously while the weasley twin yell we get potter we get potter harry sit down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd see earlier the ghost pat his arm give harry the sudden horrible feel he'd just plunge it into a bucket of ice-cold water he could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sit hagrid who catch his eye and give him the thumb up harry grin back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sit albus dumbledore harry recognize him at once from the card he'd get out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledore's silver hair be the only thing in the whole hall that shine as brightly

thing harry who be start to feel warm and sleepy look up at the high table again hagrid be drink deeply from his goblet professor mcgonagall be talk to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban be talk to a teacher with greasy black hair a hook nose and sallow skin it happen very suddenly the hook-nosed teacher look past quirrell's turban straight into harry's eyes—and a sharp hot pain shoot across the scar on harry's forehead ouch harry clap a hand to his head what be it ask percy n-nothing the pain have go as quickly as it have come harder to shake off be the feel harry have get from the teacher's look—a feel that he didn't like harry at all who's that teacher talk to professor quirrell he ask percy oh you know quirrell already do you no wonder he's look so nervous that's professor snape he teach potions but he doesn't want to—everyone know he's after quirrell's job know an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watch snape for a while but snape didn't look at him again at last the desserts too disappear and professor dumbledore get to his feet again the hall fell silent ahern—just a few more word now that we be all feed and water i have a few start-of-term notice to give you first years should note that the forest on the ground be forbid to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledore's twinkle eye flash in the direction of the weasley twin i have also be ask by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be use between class in the corridors quidditch trials will be hold in the second week of the term anyone interest in play for their house team should contact madam hooch and finally i must tell you that this year the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side be out of bound to everyone who do not wish to die a very painful death harry laugh but he be one of the few who do he's not serious he mutter to percy must be say percy frown at dumbledore it's odd because he usually give us a reason why we're not allow to go somewhere—the forest's full of dangerous beasts everyone know that i do think he might have tell us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cry dumbledore harry notice that the other teachers smile have become rather fix dumbledore give his wand a little flick as if he be try to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon fly out of it which rise high above the table and twist itself snakelike into word everyone pick their favorite tune say dumbledore and off we go and the school bellow hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our head could do with fill with some interest stuff for now they're bare and full of air dead fly and bits of fluff so teach us things worth know bring back what we've forget just do your best we'll do the rest and learn until our brain all rot everybody finish the song at different time at last only the weasley twin be leave sing along to a very slow funeral march dumbledore conduct their last few line with his wand and when they have finish he be one of those who clap loudest ah music he say wipe his eye a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trot the gryffindor first years follow percy through the chatter crowd out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harry's legs be like lead again but only because he be so tire and full of food he be too sleepy even to be surprise that the people in the portraits along the corridors whisper and point as they pass or that twice percy lead them through doorways hide behind slide panel and hang tapestries they climb more staircases yawn and drag their feet and harry be just wonder how much farther they have to go when they come to a sudden halt a bundle of walk stick be float in midair ahead of them and as percy take a step toward them they start throw themselves at him peeve percy whisper to the first years a poltergeist he raise his voice peeves—show yourself a loud rude sound like the air be let out of a balloon answer do you want me to go to the bloody baron there be a pop and a little man with wicked dark eye and a wide mouth appear float crosslegged in the air clutch the walk stick oooooooh he say with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun he swoop suddenly at them they all duck go away peeve or the baron'll hear about this i mean it bark percy peeve stick out his tongue and vanish drop the walk stick on neville's head they hear him zoom away rattle coat of armor as he pass you want to watch out for peeve say percy as they set off again the bloody baron's the only one who can control him he won't even listen to us prefects here we be at the very end of the corridor hang a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress password she say caput draconis say percy and the portrait swing forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scramble through it—neville need a leg up—and find themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs percy direct the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase—they be obviously in one of the towers—they find their bed at last five four-posters hang with deep red velvet curtain their trunks have already be bring up too tire to talk much they pull on their pajamas and fell into bed  great food isn't it ron mutter to harry through the hang get off scabbers he's chew my sheet harry be go to ask ron if he'd have any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry have eat a bite too much because he have a very strange dream he be wear professor quirrell's turban which keep talk to him tell him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it be his destiny harry tell the turban he didn't want to be in slytherin it get heavier and heavier he try to pull it off but it tighten painfully—and there be malfoy laugh at him as he struggle with it then malfoy turn into the hook-nosed teacher snape whose laugh become high and cold—there be a burst of green light and harry wake sweat and shake he roll over and fell asleep again and when he wake next day he didn't remember the dream at all chapter eight the potions master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wear the glass do you see his face do you see his scar whisper follow harry from the moment he leave his dormitory the next day people line up outside classrooms stand on tiptoe to get a look at him or double back to pass him in the corridors again star harry wish they wouldn't because he be try to concentrate on find his way to class there be a hundred and forty-two staircases at hogwarts wide sweep ones narrow rickety ones some that lead somewhere different on a friday some with a vanish step halfway up that you have to remember to jump then there be doors that wouldn't open unless you ask politely or tickle them in exactly the right place and doors that weren't really doors at all but solid wall just pretend it be also very hard to remember where anything be because it all seem to move around a lot the people in the portraits keep go to visit each other and harry be sure the coat of armor could walk the ghost didn't help either it be always a nasty shock when one of them glide suddenly through a door you be try to open nearly headless nick be always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeve the poltergeist be worth two lock doors and a trick staircase if you meet him when you be late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech get your conk even worse than peeve if that be possible be the caretaker argus filch harry and ron manage to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch find them try to force their way through a door that unluckily turn out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor he wouldn't believe they be lose be sure they be try to break into it on purpose and be threaten to lock them in the dungeons when they be rescue by professor quirrell who be pass filch own a cat call mrs norris a scrawny dust-colored creature with bulge lamp like eye just like filch's she patrol the corridors alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and she'd whisk off for filch who'd appear wheeze two second later filch know the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twin and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghost the students all hat him and it be the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick and then once you have manage to find them there be the class themselves there be a lot more to magic as harry quickly find out than wave your wand and say a few funny word they have to study the night sky through their telescope every wednesday at midnight and learn the name of different star and the movements of the planets three time a week they go out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch call professor sprout where they learn how to take care of all the strange plant and fungi and find out what they be use for easily the most bore class be history of magic which be the only one teach by a ghost professor binns have be very old indeed when he have fall asleep in front of the staff room fire and get up next morning to teach leave his body behind him binns drone on and on while they scribble down name and date and get emetic the evil and uric the oddball mix up professor flitwick the charm teacher be a tiny little wizard who have to stand on a pile of book to see over his desk at the start of their first class he take the roll call and when he reach harry's name he give an excite squeak and topple out of sight professor mcgonagall be again different harry have be quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross strict and clever she give them a talking-to the moment they sit down in her first class transfiguration be some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she say anyone mess around in my class will leave and not come back you have be warn then she change her desk into a pig and back again they be all very impress and couldn't wait to get start but soon realize they weren't go to be change the furniture into animals for a long time after take a lot of complicate note they be each give a match and start try to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger have make any difference to her match professor mcgonagall show the class how it have go all silver and pointy and give hermione a rare smile the class everyone have really be look forward to be defense against the dark arts but quirrell's lessons turn out to be a bite of a joke his classroom smell strongly of garlic which everyone say be to ward off a vampire he'd meet in romania and be afraid would be come back to get him one of these days his turban he tell them have be give to him by an african prince as a thank-you for get rid of a troublesome zombie but they weren't sure they believe this story for one thing when seamus finnigan ask eagerly to hear how quirrell have fight off the zombie quirrell go pink and start talk about the weather for another they have notice that a funny smell hang around the turban and the weasley twin insist that it be stuff full of garlic as well so that quirrell be protect wherever he go harry be very relieve to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else lot of people have come from muggle families and like him hadn't have any idea that they be witch and wizards there be so much to learn that even people like ron didn't have much of a head start friday be an important day for harry and ron they finally manage to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without get lose once what have we get today harry ask ron as he pour sugar on his porridge double potions with the slytherins say ron snape's head of slytherin house they say he always favor them—we'll be able to see if it's true wish mcgonagall favor us  say harry professor mcgonagall be head of gryffindor house but it hadn't stop her from give them a huge pile of homework the day before just then the mail arrive harry have get use to this by now but it have give him a bite of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls have suddenly stream into the great hall during breakfast circle the table until they saw their owners and drop letter and package onto their lap hedwig hadn't bring harry anything so far she sometimes fly in to nibble his ear and have a bite of toast before go off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls this morning however she flutter down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and drop a note onto harry's plate harry tear it open at once it say in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwig hagrid harry borrow ron's quill scribble yes please see you later on the back of the note and send hedwig off again it be lucky that harry have tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turn out to be the worst thing that have happen to him so far at the start-of-term banquet harry have get the idea that professor snape dislike him by the end of the first potions lesson he know he'd be wrong snape didn't dislike harry—he hat him potions lessons take place down in one of the dungeons it be colder here than up in the main castle and would have be quite creepy enough without the pickle animals float in glass jar all around the wall snape like flitwick start the class by take the roll call and like flitwick he pause at harry's name ah yes he say softly harry potter our new—celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle snigger behind their hand snape finish call the name and look up at the class his eye be black like hagrid's but they have none of hagrid's warmth they be cold and empty and make you think of dark tunnel you be here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he begin he speak in barely more than a whisper but they catch every word—like professor mcgonagall snape have y catch every word—like professor mcgonagall snape have the gift of keep a class silent without effort as there be little foolish wand-waving here many of you will hardly believe this be magic i don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmer cauldron with its shimmer fume the delicate power of liquids that creep through human vein bewitch the mind ensnare the sense i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death—if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence follow this little speech harry and ron exchange look with raise eyebrows hermione granger be on the edge of her seat and look desperate to start prove that she wasn't a dunderhead potter say snape suddenly what would i get if i add powder root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powder root of what to an infusion of what harry glance at ron who look as stump as he be hermione's hand have shoot into the air i don't know sit say harry snape's lips curl into a sneer tut tut—fame clearly isn't everything he ignore hermione's hand let's try again potter where would you look if i tell you to find me a bezoar hermione stretch her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leave her seat but harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar be he try not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who be shake with laughter i don't know sit think you wouldn't open a book before come eh potter harry force himself to keep look straight into those cold eye he have look through his book at the dursleys but do snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape be still ignore hermione's quiver hand what be the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stand up her hand stretch toward the dungeon ceiling i don't know say harry quietly i think hermione do though why don't you try her a few people laugh harry catch seamus's eye and seamus wink snape however be not please sit down he snap at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleep potion so powerful it be know as the draught of live death a bezoar be a stone take from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poison as for monkshood and wolfsbane they be the same plant which also go by the name of aconite well why aren't you all copy that down there be a sudden rummage for quills and parchment over the noise snape say and a point will be take from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didn't improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continue snape put them all into pair and set them to mix up a simple potion to cure boil he sweep around in his long black cloak watch them weigh dry nettle and crush snake fangs criticize almost everyone except malfoy whom he seem to like he be just tell everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy have stew his horn slug when cloud of acid green smoke and a loud hiss fill the dungeon neville have somehow manage to melt seamus's cauldron into a twist blob and their potion be seep across the stone floor burn hole in people's shoe within second the whole class be stand on their stool while neville who have be drench in the potion when the cauldron collapse moan in pain as angry red boil spring up all over his arm and legs idiot boy snarl snape clear the spill potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you add the porcupine quills before take the cauldron off the fire neville whimper as boil start to pop up all over his nose take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he round on harry and ron who have be work next to neville you—potter—why didn't you tell him not to add the quills think he'd make you look good if he get it wrong do you that's another point you've lose for gryffindor this be so unfair that harry open his mouth to argue but ron kick him behind their cauldron doipush it he mutter i've hear snape can turn very nasty as they climb the step out of the dungeon an hour later harry's mind be race and his spirit be low he'd lose two point for gryffindor in his very first week—why do snape hate him so much cheer up say ron snape's always take point off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they leave the castle and make their way across the ground hagrid live in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbid forest a crossbow and a pair of galoshes be outside the front door when harry knock they hear a frantic scrabble from inside and several boom bark then hagrid's voice ring out say back fang—back hagrid's big hairy face appear in the crack as he pull the door open hang on he say back fang he let them in struggle to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound there be only one room inside ham and pheasants be hang from the ceiling a copper kettle be boil on the open fire and in the corner stand a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it make yerselves at home say hagrid let go of fang who bound straight at ron and start lick his ears like hagrid fang be clearly not as fierce as he look this be ron harry tell hagrid who be pour boil water into a large teapot and put rock cake onto a plate another weasley eh say hagrid glance at ron's freckle i spend half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cake be shapeless lump with raisins that almost break their teeth but harry and ron pretend to be enjoy them as they tell hagrid all about their first lessons fang rest his head on harry's knee and drool all over his rob harry and ron be delight to hear hagrid call fitch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris i'd like ter introduce her to fang sometime d'yeh know every time i go up ter the school she follow me everywhere can't get rid of her—fitch put her up to it harry tell hagrid about snape's lesson hagrid like ron tell harry not to worry about it that snape like hardly any of the students but he seem to really hate me rubbish say hagrid why should he yet harry couldn't help think that hagrid didn't quite meet his eye when he say that how's yer brother charlie hagrid ask ron i like him a lot—great with animals harry wonder if hagrid have change the subject on purpose while ron tell hagrid all about charlie's work with dragons harry pick up a piece of paper that be lie on the table under the tea cozy it be a cut from the daily prophet gringotts break-in latest investigations continue into the break-in at gringotts on 31 july widely believe to be the work of dark wizards or witch unknown gringotts goblins today insist that nothing have be take the vault that be search have in fact be empty the same day but we're not tell you what be in there so keep your nose out if you know what's good for you say a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon harry remember ron tell him on the train that someone have try to rob gringotts but ron hadn't mention the date hagrid say harry that gringotts break-in happen on my birthday it might've be happen while we be there there be no doubt about it hagrid definitely didn't meet harry's eye this time he grunt and offer him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that be search have in fact be empty earlier that same day hagrid have empty vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it empty take out that grubby little package have that be what the thieve be look for as harry and ron walk back to the castle for dinner their pocket weigh down with rock cake they'd be too polite to refuse harry think that none of the lessons he'd have so far have give him as much to think about as tea with hagrid have hagrid collect that package just in time where be it now and do hagrid know something about snape that he didn't want to tell harry chapter nine the midnight duel harry have never believe he would meet a boy he hat more than dudley but that be before he meet draco malfoy still first-year gryffindors only have potions with the slytherins so they didn't have to put up with malfoy much or at least they didn't until they spot a notice pin up in the gryffindor common room that make them all groan fly lessons would be start on thursday—and gryffindor and slytherin would be learn together typical say harry darkly just what i always want to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he have be look forward to learn to fly more than anything else you don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself say ron reasonably anyway i know malfoy's always go on about how good he be at quidditch but i bet that's all talk malfay certainly do talk about fly a lot he complain loudly about first years never get on the house quidditch team and tell long boastful stories that always seem to end with him narrowly escape muggles in helicopters he wasn't the only one though the way seamus finnigan tell it he'd spend most of his childhood zoom around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on charlie's old broom everyone from wizarding families talk about quidditch constantly ron have already have a big argument with dean thomas who share their dormitory about soccer ron couldn't see what be excite about a game with only one ball where no one be allow to fly harry have catch ron prod dean's poster of west ham soccer team try to make the players move neville have never be on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother have never let him near one privately harry felt she'd have good reason because neville manage to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the grind hermione granger be almost as nervous about fly as neville be this be something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book—not that she hadn't try at breakfast on thursday she bore them all stupid with fly tip she'd get out of a library book call quidditch through the age neville be hang on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else be very please when hermione's lecture be interrupt by the arrival of the mail harry hadn't have a single letter since hagrid's note something that malfoy have be quick to notice of course malfoy's eagle owl be always bring him package of sweets from home which he open gloatingly at the slytherin table a barn owl bring neville a small package from his grandmother he open it excitedly and show them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seem to be full of white smoke it's a remembrall he explain gran know i forget things—this tell you if there's something you've forget to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turn red—oh his face fell because the remembrall have suddenly glow scarlet you've forget something neville be try to remember what he'd forget when draco malfoy who be pass the gryffindor table snatch the remembrall out of his hand harry and ron jump to their feet they be half hop for a reason to fight malfay but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school be there in a flash what's go on malfoy's get my remembrall professor scowl malfoy quickly drop the remembrall back on the table just look he say and he slop away with crabbe and goyle behind him at three-thirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurry down the front step onto the ground for their first fly lesson it be a clear breezy day and the grass ripple under their feet as they march down the slop lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the ground to the forbid forest whose tree be sway darkly in the distance the slytherins be already there and so be twenty broomsticks lie in neat line on the grind harry have hear fred and george weasley complain about the school broom say that some of them start to vibrate if you fly too high or always fly slightly to the leave their teacher madam hooch arrive she have short gray hair and yellow eye like a hawk well what be you all wait for she bark everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry up harry glance down at his broom it be old and some of the twig stick out at odd angle stick out your right hand over your broom call madam hooch at the front and say up upf everyone shout harry's broom jump into his hand at once but it be one of the few that do hermione granger's have simply roll over on the grind and neville's hadn't move at all perhaps broom like horse could tell when you be afraid think harry there be a quaver in neville's voice that say only too clearly that he want to keep his feet on the grind madam hooch then show them how to mount their broom without slide off the end and walk up and down the row correct their grip harry and ron be delight when she tell malfoy he'd be do it wrong for years now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the grind hard say madam hooch keep your broom steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by lean forward slightly on my whistle—three—two  but neville nervous and jumpy and frighten of be leave on the grind push off hard before the whistle have touch madam hooch's lips come back boy she shout but neville be rise straight up like a cork shoot out of a bottle—twelve feet—twenty feet harry saw his scar white face look down at the grind fall away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and  wham—a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick be still rise higher and higher and start to drift lazily toward the forbid forest and out of sight madam hooch be bend over neville her face as white as his break wrist harry hear her mutter come on boy—it's all right up you get she turn to the rest of the class none of you be to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those broom where they be or you'll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch  come on dear neville his face tear-streaked clutch his wrist hobble off with madam hooch who have her arm around him no sooner be they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter do you see his face the great lump the other slytherins join in shut up malfoy snap parvati patil ooh stick up for longbottom say pansy parkinson a hard-faced slytherin girl never think you'd like fat little crybabies parvati look say malfoy dart forward and snatch something out of the grass it's that stupid thing longbottom's gran send him the remembrall glitter in the sun as he hold it up give that here malfoy say harry quietly everyone stop talk to watch malfoy smile nastily i think i'll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find—how about—up a tree give it here harry yell but malfoy have leap onto his broomstick and take off he hadn't be lie he could fly well hover level with the topmost branch of an oak he call come and get it potter harry grab his broom no shout hermione granger madam hooch tell us not to move—you'll get us all into trouble harry ignore her blood be pound in his ears he mount the broom and kick hard against the grind and up up he soar air rush through his hair and his rob whip out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realize he'd find something he could do without be taught—this be easy this be wonderful he pull his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and hear scream and gasp of girls back on the grind and an admire whoop from ron he turn his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy look stun give it here harry call or i'll knock you off that broom oh yeah say malfoy try to sneer but look worry harry know somehow what to do he lean forward and grasp the broom tightly in both hand and it shoot toward malfay like a javelin malfoy only just get out of the way in time harry make a sharp about-face and hold the broom steady a few people below be clap no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry call the same think seem to have strike malfoy catch it if you can then he shout and he throw the glass ball high into the air and streak back toward the grind harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he lean forward and point his broom handle down—next second he be gather speed in a steep dive race the ball—wind whistle in his ears mingle with the scream of people watching—he stretch out his hand—a foot from the grind he catch it just in time to pull his broom straight and he topple gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutch safely in his fist harry potter his heart sink faster than he'd just dive professor mcgonagall be run toward them he get to his feet tremble never—in all my time at hogwarts  professor mcgonagall be almost speechless with shock and her glass flash furiously  how dare you—might have break your neck  it wasn't his fault professor  be quiet miss patil but malfoy

tell us about and use it on you hermione open her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hiss at her to be quiet and beckon them all forward they flit along corridors strip with bar of moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry expect to run into filch or mrs norris but they be lucky they speed up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoe toward the trophy room malfoy and crabbe weren't there yet the crystal trophy case glimmer where the moonlight catch them cup shield plat and statues wink silver and gold in the darkness they edge along the wall keep their eye on the doors at either end of the room harry take out his wand in case malfoy leap in and start at once the minutes creep by he's late maybe he's chickened out ron whisper then a noise in the next room make them jump harry have only just raise his wand when they hear someone speak and it wasn't malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurk in a corner it be filch speak to mrs norris horror-struck harry wave madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurry silently toward the door away from filch's voice neville's rob have barely whip round the corner when they hear filch enter the trophy room they're in here somewhere they hear him mutter probably hide this way harry mouth to the others and petrify they begin to creep down a long gallery full of suit of armor they could hear filch get nearer neville suddenly let out a frighten squeak and break into a run he trip grab ron around the waist and the pair of them topple right into a suit of armor the clang and crash be enough to wake the whole castle run harry yell and the four of them sprint down the gallery not look back to see whether filch be following—they swing around the doorpost and gallop down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they be or where they be going—they rip through a tapestry and find themselves in a hide passageway hurtle along it and come out near their charm classroom which they know be miles from the trophy room i think we've lose him harry pant lean against the cold wall and wipe his forehead neville be bend double wheeze and splutter i—told you hermione gasp clutch at the stitch in her chest i—told—you we've get to get back to gryffindor tower say ron quickly as possible malfoy trick you hermione say to harry

okay—get off neville for neville have be tug on the sleeve of harry's bathrobe for the last minute what harry turn around—and saw quite clearly what for a moment he be sure he'd walk into a nightmare—this be too much on top of everything that have happen so far they weren't in a room as he have suppose they be in a corridor the forbid corridor on the third floor and now they know why it be forbid they be look straight into the eye of a monstrous dog a dog that fill the whole space between ceiling and floor it have three head three pair of roll mad eye three nose twitch and quiver in their direction three drool mouth saliva hang in slippery rope from yellowish fangs it be stand quite still all six eye star at them and harry know that the only reason they weren't already dead be that their sudden appearance have take it by surprise but it be quickly get over that there be no mistake what those thunderous growl mean harry grope for the doorknob—between filch and death he'd take filch they fell backward—harry slam the door shut and they run they almost fly back down the corridor filch must have hurry off to look for them somewhere else because they didn't see him anywhere but they hardly cared—all they want to do be put as much space as possible between them and that monster they didn't stop run until they reach the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor where on earth have you all be she ask look at their bathrobes hang off their shoulder and their flush sweaty face never mind that—pig snout pig snout pant harry and the portrait swing forward they scramble into the common room and collapse tremble into armchairs it be a while before any of them say anything neville indeed look as if he'd never speak again what do they think they're do keep a thing like that lock up in a school say ron finally if any dog need exercise that one do hermione have get both her breath and her bad temper back again you don't use your eye any of you do you she snap didn't you see what it be stand on the floor harry suggest i wasn't look at its feet i be too busy with its head no not the floor it be stand on a trapdoor it's obviously guard something she stand up glare at them i hope you're please with yourselves we could all have be killed—or worse expel now if you don't mind i'm go to bed ron star after her his mouth open no we don't mind he say you'd think we drag her along wouldn't you but hermione have give harry something else to think about as he climb back into bed the dog be guard something what have hagrid say gringotts be the safest place in the world for something you want to hide—except perhaps hogwarts it look as though harry have find out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen be chapter ten halloween malfoy couldn't believe his eye when he saw that harry and ron be still at hogwarts the next day look tire but perfectly cheerful indeed by the next morning harry and ron think that meet the three-headed dog have be an excellent adventure and they be quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry fill ron in about the package that seem to have be move from gringotts to hogwarts and they spend a lot of time wonder what could possibly need such heavy protection it's either really valuable or really dangerous say ron or both say harry but as all they know for sure about the mysterious object be that it be about two inch long they didn't have much chance of guess what it be without further clue neither neville nor hermione show the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville care about be never go near the dog again hermione be now refuse to speak to harry and ron but she be such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an add bonus all they really want now be a way of get back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrive in the mail about a week later as the owls flood into the great hall as usual everyone's attention be catch at once by a long thin package carry by six large screech owls harry be just as interest as everyone else to see what be in this large parcel and be amaze when the owls soar down and drop it right in front of him knock his bacon to the floor they have hardly flutter out of the way when another owl drop a letter on top of the parcel harry rip open the letter first which be lucky because it say do not open the parcel at the table it contain your new nimbus two thousand but i don't want everybody know you've get a broomstick or they'll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first train session professor mcgonagall harry have difficulty hide his glee as he hand the note to ron to read a nimbus two thousand ron moan enviously i've never even touch one they leave the hall quickly want to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they find the way upstairs bar by crabbe and goyle malfoy seize the package from harry and felt it that's a broomstick he say throw it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face you'll be in for it this time potter first years aren't allow them ron couldn't resist it it's not any old broomstick he say it's a nimbus two thousand what do you say you've get at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grin at harry comets look flashy but they're not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldn't afford half the handle malfoy snap back i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appear at malfoy's elbow not argue i hope boys he squeak potter's be send a broomstick professor say malfoy quickly yes yes that's right say professor flitwick beam at harry professor mcgonagall tell me all about the special circumstances potter and what model be it a nimbus two thousand sit say harry fight not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy's face and it's really thank to malfoy here that i've get it he add harry and ron head upstairs smother their laughter at malfoy's obvious rage and confusion well it's true harry chortle as they reach the top of the marble staircase if he hadn't steal neville's remembrall i wouln't be on the team so i suppose you think that's a reward for break rule come an angry voice from just behind them hermione be stomp up the stairs look disapprovingly at the package in harry's hand i think you weren't speak to us say harry yes don't stop now say ron it's do us so much good hermione march away with her nose in the air harry have a lot of trouble keep his mind on his lessons that day it keep wander up to the dormitory where his new broomstick be lie under his bed or stray off to the quidditch field where he'd be learn to play that night he bolt his dinner that even without notice what he be eat and then rush upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sigh as the broomstick roll onto harry's bedspread even harry who know nothing about the different broom think it look wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it have a long tail of neat straight twig and nimbus two thousand write in gold near the top as seven o'clock draw nearer harry leave the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field hold never be inside the stadium before hundreds of seat be raise in stand around the field so that the spectators be high enough to see what be go on at either end of the field be three golden pole with hoop on the end they remind harry of the little plastic stick muggle children blow bubble through except that they be fifty feet high too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mount his broomstick and kick off from the grind what a feeling—he swoop in and out of the goal post and then speed up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turn wherever he want at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood have arrive fie be carry a large wooden crate under his arm harry land next to him very nice say wood his eye glint i see what mcgonagall mean you really be a natural i'm just go to teach you the rule this even then you'll be join team practice three time a week he open the crate inside be four different-sized ball right say wood now quidditch be easy enough to understand even if it's not too easy to play there be seven players on each side three of them be call chasers three chasers harry repeat as wood take out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball this ball's call the quaffle say wood the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoop to score a goal ten point every time the quaffle go through one of the hoop follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoop to score harry recite so—that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoop isn't it what's basketball say wood curiously never mind say harry quickly now there's another player on each side who's call the keeper i'm keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoop and stop the other team from score three chasers one keeper say harry who be determine to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay get that so what be they for he point at the three ball leave inside the box i'll show you now say wood take this he hand harry a small club a bite like a short baseball bat i'm go to show you what the bludgers do wood say these two be the bludgers he show harry two identical ball jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry notice that they seem to be strain to escape the strap hold them inside the box stand back wood warn harry he bend down and free one of the bludgers at once the black ball rise high in the air and then pelt straight at harry's face harry swing at it with the bat to stop it from break his nose and send it zigzag away into the air—it zoom around their head and then shoot at wood who dive on top of it and manage to pin it to the grind see wood pant force the struggle bludger back into the crate and strap it down safely the bludgers rocket around try to knock players off their broom that's why you have two beaters on each team—the weasley twin be ours—it's their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so—think you've get all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guard the goal post the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reel off very good say wood er—have the bludgers ever kill anyone harry ask hop he sound offhand never at hogwarts we've have a couple of break jaw but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team be the seeker that's you and you don't have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open don't worry the weasleys be more than a match for the bludgers—i mean they're like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reach into the crate and take out the fourth and last ball compare with the quaffle and the bludgers it be tiny about the size of a large walnut it be bright gold and have little flutter silver wing this say wood be the golden snitch and it's the most important ball of the lot it's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see it's the seeker's job to catch it you've get to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team's seeker because whichever seeker catch the snitch win his team an extra hundred and fifty point so they nearly always win that's why seekers get foul so much a game of quidditch only end when the snitch be catch so it can go on for ages—i think the record be three months they have to keep bring on substitute so the players could get some sleep well that's it—any question harry shake his head he understand what he have to do all right it be do it that be go to be the problem we won't practice with the snitch yet say wood carefully shut it back inside the crate it's too dark we might lose it let's try you out with a few of these he pull a bag of ordinary golf ball out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry be up in the air wood throw the golf ball as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch harry didn't miss a single one and wood be delight after half an hour night have really fall and they couldn't carry on that quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year say wood happily as they trudge back up to the castle i wouldn't be surprise if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have play for england if he hadn't go off chase dragons perhaps it be because he be now so busy what with quidditch practice three even a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realize that he'd already be at hogwarts two months the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever have his lessons too be become more and more interest now that they have master the basics on halloween morning they wake to the delicious smell of bake pumpkin waft through the corridors even better professor flitwick announce in charm that he think they be ready to start make object fly something they have all be die to try since they'd see him make neville's toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pair to practice harry's partner be seamus finnigan which be a relief because neville have be try to catch his eye ron however be to be work with hermione granger it be hard to tell whether ron or hermione be angrier about this she hadn't speak to either of them since the day harry's broomstick have arrive now don't forget that nice wrist movement we've be practice squeak professor flitwick perch on top of his pile of book as usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and say the magic word properly be very important too—never forget wizard baruffio who say s instead of f and find himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest it be very difficult harry and seamus swish and flick but the feather they be suppose to be send skyward just lay on the desktop seamus get so impatient that he prod it with his wand and set fire to it—harry have to put it out with his hat ron at the next table wasn't have much more luck wingardium leviosa he shout wave his long arm like a windmill you're say it wrong harry hear hermione snap it's wing-gar-dium levi-o-sa make the gar nice and long you do it then if you're so clever ron snarl hermione roll up the sleeves of her gown flick her wand and say wingardium leviosa their feather rise off the desk and hover about four feet above their head oh well do cry professor flitwick clap everyone see here miss granger's do it ron be in a very bad mood by the end of the class it's no wonder no one can stand her he say to harry as they push their way into the crowd corridor she's a nightmare honestly  someone knock into harry as they hurry past him it be hermione harry catch a glimpse of her face—and be startle to see that she be in tear i think she hear you so say ron but he look a bite uncomfortable she must've notice she's get no friends hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't see all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overhear parvati patil tell her friend lavender that hermione be cry in the girls bathroom and want to be leave alone ron look still more awkward at this but a moment later they have enter the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their mind a thousand live bat flutter from the wall and ceiling while a thousand more swoop over the table in low black cloud make the candle in the pumpkins stutter the feast appear suddenly on the golden plat as it have at the start-of-term banquet harry be just help himself to a bake potato when professor quirrell come sprint into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face everyone star as he reach professor dumbledore's chair slump against the table and gasp troll—in the dungeons—thought you ought to know he then sink to the floor in a dead faint there be an uproar it take several purple firecrackers explode from the end of professor dumbledore's wand to bring silence prefects he rumble lead your house back to the dormitories immediately percy be in his element follow me stick together first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my order stay close behind me now make way first years come through excuse me i'm a prefect how could a troll get in harry ask as they climb the stairs don't ask me they're suppose to be really stupid say ron maybe peeve let it in for a halloween joke they pass different group of people hurry in different directions as they jostle their way through a crowd of confuse hufflepuffs harry suddenly grab ron's arm i've just thought—hermione what about her she doesn't know about the troll ron bite his lip oh all right he snap but percy'd better not see us duck down they join the hufflepuffs go the other way slip down a desert side corridor and hurry off toward the girls bathroom they have just turn the corner when they hear quick footsteps behind them percy hiss ron pull harry behind a large stone griffin peer around it however they saw not percy but snape he cross the corridor and disappear from view what's he do harry whisper why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they creep along the next corridor after snape's fade footsteps he's head for the third floor harry say but ron hold up his hand can you smell something harry sniff and a foul stench reach his nostrils a mixture of old sock and the kind of public toilet no one seem to clean and then they hear it—a low grunt and the shuffle footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed—at the end of a passage to the leave something huge be move toward them they shrink into the shadow and watch as it emerge into a patch of moonlight it be a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin be a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perch on top like a coconut it have short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet the smell come from it be incredible it be hold a huge wooden club which drag along the floor because its arm be so long the troll stop next to a doorway and peer inside it waggle its long ears make up its tiny mind then slouch slowly into the room the key in the lock harry mutter we could lock it in good idea say ron nervously they edge toward the open door mouth dry pray the troll wasn't about to come out of it with one great leap harry manage to grab the key slam the door and lock it yes flush with their victory they start to run back up the passage but as they reach the corner they hear something that make their hearts stop—a high petrify scream—and it be come from the chamber they'd just chain up oh no say ron pale as the bloody baron it's the girls bathroom harry gasp hermione they say together it be the last thing they want to do but what choice do they have wheel around they sprint back to the door and turn the key fumble in their panic harry pull the door open and they run inside hermione granger be shrink against the wall opposite look as if she be about to faint the troll be advance on her knock the sink off the wall as it go confuse it harry say desperately to ron and seize a tap he throw it as hard as he could against the wall the troll stop a few feet from hermione it lumber around blink stupidly to see what have make the noise its mean little eye saw harry it hesitate then make for him instead lift its club as it go oy pea-brain yell ron from the other side of the chamber and he throw a metal pipe at it the troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hit its shoulder but it hear the yell and pause again turn its ugly snout toward ron instead give harry time to run around it come on run run harry yell at hermione try to pull her toward the door but she couldn't move she be still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror the shout and the echo seem to be drive the troll berserk it roar again and start toward ron who be nearest and have no way to escape harry then do something that be both very brave and very stupid he take a great run jump and manage to fasten his arm around the troll's neck from behind the troll couldn't feel harry hang there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bite of wood up its nose and harry's wand have still be in his hand when he'd jumped—it have go straight up one of the troll's nostrils howl with pain the troll twist and flail its club with harry cling on for dear life any second the troll be go to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club hermione have sink to the floor in fright ron pull out his own wand—not know what he be go to do he hear himself cry the first spell that come into his head wingardium leviosa the club fly suddenly out of the troll's hand rise high high up into the air turn slowly over—and drop with a sicken crack onto its owner's head the troll sway on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that make the whole room tremble harry get to his feet he be shake and out of breath ron be stand there with his wand still raise star at what he have do it be hermione who speak first be it—dead i don't think so say harry i think it's just be knock out he bend down and pull his wand out of the troll's nose it be cover in what look like lumpy gray glue urgh—troll boogers he wipe it on the troll's trousers a sudden slam and loud footsteps make the three of them look up they hadn't realize what a racket they have be make but of course someone downstairs must have hear the crash and the troll's roar a moment later professor mcgonagall have come burst into the room closely follow by snape with quirrell bring up the rear quirrell take one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sit quickly down on a toilet clutch his heart snape bend over the troll professor mcgonagall be look at ron and harry harry have never see her look so angry her lips be white hop of win fifty point for gryffindor fade quickly from harry's mind what on earth be you think of say professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry look at ron who be still stand with his wand in the air you're lucky you weren't kill why aren't you in your dormitory snape give harry a swift pierce look harry look at the floor he wish ron would put his wand down then a small voice come out of the shadow please professor mcgonagall—they be look for me miss granger hermione have manage to get to her feet at last i go look for the troll because i—i think i could deal with it on my own—you know because i've read all about them ron drop his wand hermione granger tell a downright lie to a teacher if they hadn't find me i'd be dead now harry stick his wand up its nose and ron knock it out with its own club they didn't have time to come and fetch anyone it be about to finish me off when they arrive harry and ron try to look as though this story wasn't new to them well—in that case say professor mcgonagall star at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackle a mountain troll on your own hermione hang her head harry be speechless hermione be the last person to do anything against the rule and here she be pretend she have to get them out of trouble it be as if snape have start hand out sweets miss granger five point will be take from gryffindor for this say professor mcgonagall i'm very disappoint in you if you're not hurt at all you'd better get off to gryffindor tower students be finish the feast in their house hermione leave professor mcgonagall turn to harry and ron well i still say you be lucky but not many first years could have take on a full-grown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five point professor dumbledore will be inform of this you may go they hurry out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they have climb two floor up it be a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else we should have get more than ten point ron grumble five you mean once she's take off hermione's good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admit mind you we do save her she might not have need save if we hadn't lock the thing in with her harry remind him they have reach the portrait of the fat lady pig snout they say and enter the common room be pack and noisy everyone be eat the food that have be send up hermione however stand alone by the door wait for them there be a very embarrass pause then none of them look at each other they all say thank and hurry off to get plat but from that moment on hermione granger become their friend there be some things you can't share without end up like each other and knock out a twelve-foot mountain troll be one of them chapter eleven quidditch as they enter november the weather turn very cold the mountains around the school become icy gray and the lake like chill steel every morning the grind be cover in frost hagrid could be see from the upstairs windows defrost broomsticks on the quidditch field bundle up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boot the quidditch season have begin on saturday harry would be play in his first match after weeks of train gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor win they would move up into second place in the house championship hardly anyone have see harry play because wood have decide that as their secret weapon harry should be keep well secret but the news that he be play seeker have leak out somehow and harry didn't know which be worse—people tell him he'd be brilliant or people tell him they'd be run around underneath him hold a mattress it be really lucky that harry now have hermlone as a friend he didn't know how he'd have get through all his homework without her what with all the last-minute quidditch practice wood be make them do she have also tent him quidditch through the age which turn out to be a very interest read harry learn that there be seven hundred ways of commit a quidditch foul and that all of them have happen during a world cup match in 1473 that seekers be usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seem to happen to them that although people rarely die play quidditch referee have be know to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert hermione have become a bite more relax about break rule since harry and ron have save her from the mountain troll and she be much nicer for it the day before harry's first quidditch match the three of them be out in the freeze courtyard during break and she have conjure them up a bright blue fire that could be carry around in a jam jar they be stand with their back to it get warm when snape cross the yard harry notice at once that snape be limp harry ron and hermione move closer together to block the fire from view they be sure it wouldn't be allow unfortunately something about their guilty face catch snape's eye he limp over he hadn't see the fire but he seem to be look for a reason to tell them off anyway what's that you've get there potter it be quidditch through the age harry show him library book be not to be take outside the school say snape give it to me five point from gryffindor he's just make that rule up harry mutter angrily as snape limp away wonder what's wrong with his leg dunno but i hope it's really hurt him say ron bitterly the gryffindor common room be very noisy that even harry ron and hermione sit together next to a window hermione be check harry and ron's charm homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by ask her to read it through they get the right answer anyway harry felt restless he want quidditch through the age back to take his mind off his nerve about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape get up he tell ron and hermione he be go to ask snape if he could have it better you than me they say together but harry have an idea that snape wouldn't refuse if there be other teachers listen he make his way down to the staffroom and knock there be no answer he knock again nothing perhaps snape have leave the book in there it be worth a try he push the door ajar and peer inside—and a horrible scene meet his eye snape and filch be inside alone snape be hold his rob above his knees one of his legs be bloody and mangle filch be hand snape bandage blast thing snape be say how be you suppose to keep your eye on all three head at once harry try to shut the door quietly but  potter snape's face be twist with fury as he drop his rob quickly to hide his leg harry gulp i just wonder if i could have my book back get out out harry leave before snape could take any more point from gryffindor he sprint back upstairs do you get it ron ask as harry join them what's the matter in a low whisper harry tell them what he'd see you know what this mean he finish breathlessly he try to get past that three-headed dog at halloween that's where he be go when we saw him—he's after whatever it's guard and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermione's eye be wide no—he wouldn't she say i know he's not very nice but he wouldn't try and steal something dumbledore be keep safe honestly hermione you think all teachers be saint or something snap ron i'm with harry i wouldn't put anything past snape but what's he after what's that dog guard harry go to bed with his head buzz with the same question neville be snore loudly but harry couldn't sleep he try to empty his mind—he need to sleep he have to he have his first quidditch match in a few hours—but the expression on snape's face when harry have see his leg wasn't easy to forget the next morning dawn very bright and cold the great hall be full of the delicious smell of fry sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone look forward to a good quidditch match you've get to eat some breakfast i don't want anything just a bite of toast wheedle hermione i'm not hungry harry felt terrible in an hour's time he'd be walk onto the field harry you need your strength say seamus finnigan seekers be always the ones who get clobber by the other team thank seamus say harry watch seamus pile ketchup on his sausages by eleven o'clock the whole school seem to be out in the stand around the quidditch pitch many students have binoculars the seat might be raise high in the air but it be still difficult to see what be go on sometimes ron and hermione join neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for harry they have paint a large banner on one of the sheet scabbers have ruin it say potter for president and dean who be good at draw have do a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione have perform a tricky little charm so that the paint flash different color meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team be change into their scarlet quidditch rob slytherin would be play in green wood clear his throat for silence okay men he say and women say chaser angelina johnson and women wood agree this be it the big one say fred weasley the one we've all be wait for say george we know oliver's speech by heart fred tell harry we

you harry follow fred and george out of the locker room and hop his knees weren't go to give way walk onto the field to loud cheer madam hooch be referee she stand in the middle of the field wait for the two team her broom in her hand now i want a nice fair game all of you she say once they be all gather around her harry notice that she seem to be speak particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a sixth year harry think flint look as if he have some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the flutter banner high above flash potter for president over the crowd his heart skip he felt braver mount your broom please harry clamber onto his nimbus two thousand madam hooch give a loud blast on her silver whistle fifteen broom rise up high high into the air they be off and the quaffle be take immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor—what an excellent chaser that girl be and rather attractive too  jordan sorry professor the weasley twin friend lee jordan be do the commentary for the match closely watch by professor mcgonagall and she's really belt along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver wood's last year only a reserve—back to johnson and—no the slytherins have take the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gain the quaffle and off he goes—flint fly like an eagle up there—he's go to scno stop by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle—that's chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and—ouch—that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger—quaffle take by the slytherins—that's adrian pucey speed off toward the goal post but he's block by a second bludger—sent his way by fred or george weasley can't tell which—nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes—she's really flying—dodges a speed bludger—the goal post be ahead—come on now angelina—keeper bletchley dives—misses—gryffindors score gryffindor cheer fill the cold air with howl and moan from the slytherins budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeeze together to give hagrid enough space to join them bin watchin from me hut say hagrid pat a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isn't the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet eh nope say ron harry hasn't have much to do yet keep outta trouble though that's somethin say hagrid raise his binoculars and peer skyward at the speck that be harry way up above them harry be glide over the

they be suppose to be do as they hang in midair to watch harry be faster than higgs—he could see the little round ball wing flutter dart up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed  wham a roar of rage echo from the gryffindors below—marcus flint have block harry on purpose and harry's broom spin off course harry hold on for dear life foul scream the gryffindors madam hooch speak angrily to flint

mcgonagall i mean after that open and revolt foul jordan i'm warn you  all right all right flint nearly kill the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone i'm sure so a penalty to gryffindor take by spinner who put it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it be as harry dodge another bludger which go spin dangerously past his head that it happen his broom give a sudden frighten lurch for a split second he think he be go to fall he grip the broom tightly with both his hand and knees he'd never felt anything like that it happen again it be as though the broom be try to buck him off but nimbus two thousands do not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry try to turn back toward the gryffindor goalposts—he have half a mind to ask wood to call time-out—and then he realize that his broom be completely out of his control he couldn't turn it he couldn't direct it at all it be zigzag through the air and every now and then make violent swish movements that almost unseat him lee be still commentate slytherin in possession—flint with the quaffle—passes spinnet—passes bell—hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it break his nose—only joke professor—slytherins score—a no the slytherins be cheer no one seem to have notice that harry's broom be behave strangely it be carryinghim slowly higher away from the game jerk and twitch as it go

the broom say hermione what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione have disappear ron turn the binoculars back on harry his broom be vibrate so hard it be almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd be on its feet watch terrify as the weasleys fly up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their broom but it be no good—every time they get near him the broom would jump higher still they drop lower and circle beneath him obviously hop to catch him if he fell marcus flint seize the quaffle and score five time without anyone notice come on hermione ron mutter desperately hermione have fight her way across to the stand where snape stand and be now race along the row behind him she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knock professor

wasn't go back to privet drive for christmas professor mcgonagall have come around the week before make a list of students who would be stay for the holiday and harry have sign up at once he didn't feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas he'd ever have ron and his brothers be stay too because mr and mrs weasley be go to romania to visit charlie when they leave the

be trail them over the branch of the new tree the library say hagrid follow them out of the hall just before the holiday bite keen aren't yeh oh we're not work harry tell him brightly ever since you mention nicolas flamel we've be try to find out who he be you what hagrid look shock listen here—i've tell yeh—drop it it's nothin to you what that dog's guardin we just want to know who nicolas flamel be that's all say hermione unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry add we must've be through hundreds of book already and we can't find him anywhere—just give us a hint—i know i've read his name somewhere i'm sayin nothin say hagrid flatly just have to find out for ourselves then say ron and they leave hagrid look disgruntle and hurry off to the library they have indeed be search book for flamel's name ever since hagrid have let it slip because how else be they go to find out what snape be try to steal the trouble be it be very hard to know where to begin not know what flamel might have do to get himself into a book he wasn't in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical name of our time he be miss too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry and then of course there be the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of book thousands of shelve hundreds of narrow row hermione take out a list of subject and title she have decide to search while ron stride off down a row of book and start pull them off the shelve at random harry wander over to the restrict section he have be wonder for a while if flamel wasn't somewhere in there unfortunately you need a specially sign note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restrict book and he know he'd never get one these be the book contain powerful dark magic never teach at hogwarts and only read by older students study advance defense against the dark arts what be you look for boy nothing say harry madam pince the librarian brandish a feather duster at him you'd better get out then go on—out wish he'd be a bite quicker at think up some story harry leave the library he ron and hermione have already agree they'd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they be sure she'd be able to tell them but they couldn't risk snape hear what they be up to harry wait outside in the corridor to see if the other two have find anything but he wasn't very hopeful they have be look for two weeks after a but as they only have odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprise they'd find nothing what they really need be a nice long search without madam pince breathe down their neck five minutes later ron and hermione join him shake their head they go off to lunch you will keep look while i'm away won't you say hermione and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parent if they know who flamel be say ron it'd be safe to ask them very safe as they're both dentists say hermione once the holiday have start ron and harry be have too good a time to think much about flamel they have the dormitory to themselves and the common room be far emptier than usual so they be able to get the good armchairs by the fire they sit by the hour eat anything they could spear on a toast fork—bread english muffins marshmallows—and plot ways of get malfoy expel which be fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work ron also start teach harry wizard chess this be exactly like muggle chess except that the figure be alive which make it a lot like direct troop in battle ron's set be very old and batter like everything else he own it have once belong to someone else in his family—in this case his grandfather however old chessmen weren't a drawback at all ron know them so well he never have trouble get them to do what he want harry play with chessmen seamus finnigan have lend him and they didn't trust him at all he wasn't a very good player yet and they keep shout different bits of advice at him which be confuse don't send me there can't you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry go to bed look forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expect any present at all when he wake early in the morning however the first thing he saw be a small pile of package at the foot of his bed merry christmas say ron sleepily as harry scramble out of bed and pull on his bathrobe you too say harry will you look at this i've get some present what do you expect turnips say ron turn to his own pile which be a lot bigger than harry's harry pick up the top parcel it be wrap in thick brown paper and scrawl across it be to harry from hagrid inside be a roughly cut wooden flute hagrid have obviously whittle it himself harry blow it—it sound a bite like an owl a second very small parcel contain a note we receive your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia tap to the note be a fifty-pence piece that's friendly say harry ron be fascinate by the fifty pence weird he say nmat a shape this be money you can keep it say harry laugh at how please ron be hagrid and my aunt and uncle—so who send these i think i know who that one's from say ron turn a bite pink and point to a very lumpy parcel my mom i tell her you didn't expect any present and—oh no he groan she's make you a weasley sweater harry

flavor bean he'd get from hermione if that's what i think it is—they're really rare and really valuable what be it harry pick the shin silvery cloth off the floor it be strange to the touch like water weave into material it's an invisibility cloak say ron a look of awe on his face i'm sure it is—try it on harry throw the cloak around his shoulder and ron give a yell it be look down harry look down at his feet but they be go he dash to the mirror sure enough his reflection look back at him just his head suspend in midair his body completely invisible he pull the cloak over his head and his reflection vanish completely there's a note say ron suddenly a note fell out of it harry pull off the cloak and seize the letter write in narrow loopy write he have never see before be the follow word your father leave this in my possession before he die it be time it be return to you use it well a very merry christmas to you there be no signature harry star at the note ron be admire the cloak i'd give anything for one of these he say anything what's the matter nothing say harry he felt very strange who have send the cloak have it really once belong to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door be fling open and fred and george weasley bound in harry stuff the cloak quickly out of sight he didn't feel like share it with anyone else yet merry christmas hey look—harry's get a weasley sweater too fred and george be wear blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harry's be better than ours though say fred hold up harry's sweater she obviously make more of an effort if you're not family why aren't you wear yours ron george demand come on get it on they're lovely and warm i hate maroon ron moan halfheartedly as he pull it over his head you haven't get a letter on yours george observe i suppose she think you don't forget your name but we're not stupid—we know we're call gred and forge what's all th be noise percy weasley stick his head through the door look disapprove he have clearly get halfway through unwrap his present as he too carry a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seize p for prefect get it on percy come on we're all wear ours even harry get one i—don't—want say percy thickly as the twin force the sweater over his head knock his glass askew and you're not sit with the prefects today either say george christmas be a time for family they frog-marched percy from the room his arm pin to his side by his sweater harry have never in all his life have such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boil potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of butter peas silver boat of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce—and stack of wizard crackers every few feet along the table these fantastic party favor be nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually buy with their little plastic toy and their flimsy paper hat inside harry pull a wizard cracker with fred and it didn't just bang it go off with a blast like a cannon and engulf them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside explode a rear admiral's hat and several live white mice up at the high table dumbledore have swap his point wizard's hat for a flower bonnet and be chuckle merrily at a joke professor flitwick have just read him flame christmas puddings follow the turkey percy nearly break his teeth on a silver sickle embed in his slice harry watch hagrid get redder and redder in the face as he call for more wine finally kiss professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harry's amazement giggle and blush her top hat lopsided when harry finally leave the table he be lade down with a stack of things out of the crackers include a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloon a grow-your-own-warts kit and his own new wizard chess set the white mice have disappear and harry have a nasty feel they be go to end up as mrs norris's christmas dinner harry and the weasleys spend a happy afternoon have a furious snowball fight on the ground then cold wet and gasp for breath they return to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry break in his new chess set by lose spectacularly to ron he suspect he wouldn't have lose so badly if percy hadn't try to help him so much after a meal of turkey sandwich crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they'd steal his prefect badge it have be harry's best christmas day ever yet something have be nag at the back of his mind all day not until he climb into bed be he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever have send it ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as he'd draw the curtain of his four-poster harry lean over the side of his own bed and pull the cloak out from under it his father's this have be his father's he let the material flow over his hand smoother than silk light as air use it well the note have say he have to try it now he slip out of bed and wrap the cloak around himself look down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadow it be a very funny feel use it well suddenly harry felt wide-awake the whole of hogwarts be open to him in this cloak excitement flood through him as he stand there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ron grunt in his sleep should harry wake him something hold him back—his father's cloak—he felt that this time—the first time—he want to use it alone he creep out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climb through the portrait hole who's there squawk the fat lady harry say nothing he walk quickly down the corridor where should he go he stop his heart race and think and then it come to him the restrict section in the library he'd be able to read as long as he like as long as it take to find out who flamel be he set off draw the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walk the library be pitch-black and very eerie harry light a lamp to see his way along the row of book the lamp look as if it be float along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm support it the sight give him the creep the restrict section be right at the back of the library step ping carefully over the rope that separate these book from the rest of the library he hold up his lamp to read the title they didn't tell him much their peel fade gold letter spell word in languages harry couldn't understand some have no title at all one book have a dark stain on it that look horribly like blood the hairs on the back of harry's neck prickle maybe he be imagine it maybe not but he think a faint whisper be come from the book as though they know someone be there who shouldn't be he have to start somewhere set the lamp down carefully on the floor he look along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume catch his eye he pull it out with difficulty because it be very heavy and balance it on his knee let it fall open a pierce bloodcurdling shriek split the silence—the book be scream harry snap it shut but the shriek go on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumble backward and knock over his lamp which go out at once panic he hear footsteps come down the corridor outside—stuffing the shriek book back on the shelf he run for it he pass filch in the doorway filch's pale wild eye look straight through him and harry slip under filch's outstretched arm and streak off up the corridor the book's shriek still ring in his ears he come to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he have be so busy get away from the library he hadn't pay attention to where he be go perhaps because it be dark he didn't recognize where he be at all there be a suit of armor near the kitchens he know but he must be five floor above there you ask me to come directly to you professor if anyone be wander around at night and somebody's be in the library restrict section harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he be filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice be get nearer and to his horror it be snape who reply the restrict section well they can't be far we'll catch them harry stand root to the spot as filch and snape come around the corner ahead they couldn't see him of course but it be a narrow corridor and if they come much nearer they'd knock right into him—the cloak didn't stop him from be solid he back away as quietly as he could a door stand ajar to his leave it be his only hope he squeeze through it hold his breath try not to move it and to his relief he manage to get inside the room without their notice anything they walk straight past and harry lean against the wall breathe deeply listen to their footsteps die away that have be close very close it be a few second before he notice anything about the room he have hide in it look like an unused classroom the dark shape of desks and chair be pile against the wall and there be an upturned wastepaper basket—but prop against the wall face him be something that didn't look as if it belong there something that look as if someone have just put it there to keep it out of the way it be a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame stand on two claw feet there be an inscription carve around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fade now that there be no sound of filch and snape harry move nearer to the mirror want to look at himself but see no reflection again he step in front of it he have to clap his hand to his mouth to stop himself from scream he whirl around his heart be pound far more furiously than when the book have screamed—for he have see not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people stand right behind him but the room be empty breathe very fast he turn slowly back to the mirror there he be reflect in it white and scared-looking and there reflect behind him be at least ten others harry look over his shoulder—but still no one be there or be they all invisible too be he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick be that it reflect them invisible or not he look in the mirror again a woman stand right behind his reflection be smile at him and wave he reach out a hand and felt the air behind him if she be really there he'd touch her their reflections be so close together but he felt only air—she and the others exist only in the mirror she be a very pretty woman she have dark red hair and her eyes—her eye be just like mine harry think edge a little closer to the glass bright green—exactly the same shape but then he notice that she be cry smile but cry at the same time the tall thin black-haired man stand next to her put his arm around her he wear glass and his hair be very untidy it stick up at the back just as harry's do harry be so close to the mirror now that his nose be nearly touch that of his reflection mom he whisper dad they just look at him smile and slowly harry look into the face of the other people in the mirror and saw other pair of green eye like his other nose like his even a little old man who look as though he have harry's knobbly knees—harry be look at his family for the first time in his life the potter smile and wave at harry and he star hungrily back at them his hand press flat against the glass as though he be hop to fall right through it and reach them he have a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stand there he didn't know the reflections do not fade and he look and look until a distant noise bring him back to his sense he couldn't stay here he have to find his way back to bed he tear his eye away from his mother's face whisper i'll come back and hurry from the room you could have wake me up say ron crossly you can come tonight i'm go back i want to show you the mirror i'd like to see your mom and dad ron say eagerly and i want to see all your family all the weasleys you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time say ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only show dead people shame about not find flamel though have some bacon or something why aren't you eat anything harry couldn't eat he have see his parent and would be see them again tonight he have almost forget about flamel it didn't seem very important anymore who care what the three head dog be guard what do it matter if snape steal it really be you all right say ron you look odd what harry fear most be that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron cover in the cloak too they have to walk much more slowly the next night they try retrace harry's route from the library wander around the dark passageways for nearly an hour i'm freeze say ron let's forget it and go back no harry hiss i know it's here somewhere they pass the ghost of a tall witch glide in the opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron start moan that his feet be dead with cold harry spot the suit of armor it's here—just here—yes they push the door open harry drop the cloak from around his shoulder and run to the mirror there they be his mother and father beam at the sight of him see harry whisper i can't see anything look look at them all there be load of them i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i be harry step aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldn't see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas ron though be star transfix at his image look at me he say can you see all your family stand around you no—i'm alone—but i'm different—i look older—and i'm head boy what i am—i'm wear the badge like bill use to—and i'm hold the house cup and the quidditch cup—i'm quidditch captain too ron tear his eye away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry do you think this mirror show the future how can it all my family be dead—let me have another look  you have it to yourself all last night give me a bite more time you're only hold the quidditch cup what's interest about that i want to see my parent don't push me  a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion they hadn't realize how loudly they have be talk quick ron throw the cloak back over them as the luminous eye of mrs norris come round the door ron and harry stand quite still both think the same thing—did the cloak work on cat after what seem an age she turn and leave this isn't safe—she might have go for filch i bet she hear us come on and ron pull harry out of the room the snow still hadn't melt the next morning want to play chess harry say ron no why don't we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what you're think about harry that mirror don't go back tonight why not i dunno i've just get a bad feel about it—and anyway you've have too many close shave already filch snape and mrs norris be wander around so what if they can't see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something over you sound like hermione i'm serious harry don't go but harry only have one think in his head which be to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasn't go to stop him that third night he find his way more quickly than before he be walk so fast he know he be make more noise than be wise but he didn't meet anyone and there be his mother and father smile at him again and one of his grandfathers nod happily harry sink down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there be nothing to stop him from stay here all night with his family nothing at all except  so—back again harry harry felt as though his insides have turn to ice he look behind him sit on one of the desks by the wall be none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walk straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't notice him i didn't see you sir strange how nearsighted be invisible can make you say dumbledore and harry be relieve to see that he be smile so say dumbledore slip off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discover the delight of the mirror of erised i didn't know it be call that sir but i expect you've realize by now what it do it—well—it show me my family  and it show your friend ron himself as head boy how do you know  i don't need a cloak to become invisible say dumbledore gently now can you think what the mirror of erised show us all harry shake his head let me explain the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that be he would look into it and see himself exactly as he be do that help harry think then he say slowly it show us what we want whatever we want yes and no say dumbledore quietly it show us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts you who have never know your family see them stand around you ronald weasley who have always be overshadow by his brothers see himself stand alone the best of all of them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have waste away before it entrance by what they have see or be drive mad not know if what it show be real or even possible the mirror will be move to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go look for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepare it do not do to dwell on dream and forget to live remember that now why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stand up sir—professor dumbledore can i ask you something obviously you've just do so dumbledore smile you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself hold a pair of thick woolen sock harry star one can never have enough sock say dumbledore another christmas have come and go and i didn't get a single pair people will insist on give me book it be only when he be back in bed that it strike harry that dumbledore might not have be quite truthful but then he think as he shove scabbers off his pillow it have be quite a personal question chapter thirteen nicolas flamel dumbledore have convince harry not to go look for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holiday the invisibility cloak stay fold at the bottom of his trunk harry wish he could forget what he'd see in the mirror as easily but he couldn't he start have nightmares over and over again he dream about his parent disappear in a flash of green light while a high voice cackle with laughter you see dumbledore be right that mirror could drive you mad say ron when harry tell him about these drearns hermione who come back the day before term start take a different view of things she be tear between horror at the idea of harry be out of bed roam the school three nights in a row if filch have catch you and disappointment that he hadn't at least find out who nicolas flamel be they have almost give up hope of ever find flamel in a library book even though harry be still sure he'd read the name somewhere once term have start they be back to skim through book for ten minutes during their break harry have even less time than the other two because quidditch practice have start again wood be work the team harder than ever even the endless rain that have replace the snow couldn't dampen his spirit the weasleys complain that wood be become a fanatic but harry be on wood's side if they win their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years quite apart from want to win harry find that he have fewer nightmares when he be tire out after train then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood give the team a bite of bad news he'd just get very angry with the weasleys who keep dive-bomb each other and pretend to fall off their broom will you stop mess around he yell that's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match snape's referee this time and he'll be look for any excuse to knock point off gryffindor george weasley really do fall off his broom at these word snape's referee he splutter through a mouthful of mud when's he ever referee a quidditch match he's not go to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team land next to george to complain too it's not my fault say wood we've just get to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasn't get an excuse to pick on us which be all very well think harry but he have another reason for not want snape near him while he be play quidditch the rest of the team hang back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry head straight back to the gryffindor common room where he find ron and hermione play chess chess be the only thing hermione ever lose at something harry and ron think be very good for her don't talk to me for a moment say ron when harry sit down next to him i need to concen  he catch sight of harry's face what's the matter with you you look terrible speak quietly so that no one else would hear harry tell the other two about snape's sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee don't play say hermione at once say you're ill say ron pretend to break your leg hermione suggest really break your leg say ron i can't say harry there isn't a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor can't play at all at that moment neville topple into the common room how he have manage to climb through the portrait hole be anyone's guess because his legs have be stick together with what they recognize at once as the leg-locker curse he must have have to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower everyone fell over laugh except hermione who leap up and perform the countercurse neville's legs spring apart and he get to his feet tremble what happen hermione ask him lead him over to sit with harry and ron malfoy say neville shakily i meet him outside the library he say he'd be look for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urge neville report him neville shake his head i don't want more trouble he mumble you've get to stand up to him neville say ron he's use to walk all over people but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier there's no need to tell me i'm not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoy's already do that neville choke out harry felt in the pocket of his rob and pull out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione have give him for christmas he give it to neville who look as though he might cry you're worth twelve of malfoy harry say the sort hat choose you for gryffindor didn't it and where's malfoy in stink slytherin neville's lips twitch in a weak smile as he unwrap the frog thank harry i think i'll go to bed d'you want the card you collect them don't you as neville walk away harry look at the famous wizard card dumbledore again he say he be the first one i ever he gasp he star at the back of the card then he look up at ron and hermione i've find him he whisper i've find flamel i tell you i'd read the name somewhere before i read it on the train come here—listen to this dumbledore be particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve use of dragon's blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel hermione jump to her feet she hadn't look so excite since they'd get back the mark for their very first piece of homework stay there she say and she sprint up the stairs to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely have time to exchange mystify look before she be dash back an enormous old book in her arm i never think to look in here she whisper excitedly i get this out of the library weeks ago for a bite of light read light say ron but hermione tell him to be quiet until she'd look something up and start flick frantically through the page mutter to herself at last she find what she be look for i know it i know it be we allow to speak yet say ron grumpily hermione ignore him nicolas flamel she whisper dramatically be the only know maker of the sorcerer's stone this didn't have quite the effect she'd expect the what say harry and ron oh honestly don't you two read look—read that there she push the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy be concern with make the sorcerer's stone a legendary substance with astonish power the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produce the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal there have be many report of the sorcerer's stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belong to mr nicolas flamel the note alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrate his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year enjoy a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fifty-eight see say hermione when harry and ron have finish the dog must be guard flamel's sorcerer's stone i bet he ask dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they're friends and he know someone be after it that's why he want the stone move out of gringotts a stone that make gold and stop you from ever die say harry no wonder snape's after it anyone would want it and no wonder we couldn't find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry say ron he's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five be he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copy down different ways of treat werewolf bite harry and ron be still discuss what they'd do with a sorcerer's stone if they have one it wasn't until ron say he'd buy his own quidditch team that harry remember about snape and the come match i'm go to play he tell ron and hermione if i don't all the slytherins will think i'm just too scar to face snape i'll show them it'll really wipe the smile off their face if we win just as long as we're not wipe you off the field say hermione as the match draw nearer however harry become more and more nervous whatever he tell ron and hermione the rest of the team wasn't too calm either the idea of overtake slytherin in the house championship be wonderful no one have do it for seven years but would they be allow to with such a bias referee harry didn't know whether he be imagine it or not but he seem to keep run into snape wherever he go at time he even wonder whether snape be follow him try to catch him on his own potions lessons be turn into a sort of weekly torture snape be so horrible to harry could snape possibly know they'd find out about the sorcerer's stone harry didn't see how he could—yet he sometimes have the horrible feel that snape could read mind harry know when they wish him good luck outside the locker room the next afternoon that ron and hermione be wonder whether they'd ever see him alive again this wasn't what you'd call comfort harry hardly hear a word of wood's pep talk as he pull on his quidditch rob and pick up his nimbus two thousand ron and hermione meanwhile have find a place in the stand next to neville who couldn't understand why they look so grim and worry or why they have both bring their wands to the match little do harry know that ron and hermione have be secretly practice the leg-locker curse they'd get the idea from malfoy use it on neville and be ready to use it on snape if he show any sign of want to hurt harry now don't forget it's locomotor mortis hermione mutter as ron slip his wand up his sleeve i know ron snap don't nag back in the locker room wood have take harry aside don't want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it's now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole school's out there say fred weasley peer out of the door even—blimey—dumbledore's come to watch harry's heart do a somersault dumbledore he say dash to the door to make sure fred be right there be no mistake that silver beard harry could have laugh out loud with relief he be safe there be simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore be watch perhaps that be why snape be look so angry as the team march onto the field something that ron notice too i've never see snape look so mean he tell hermione look they're off ouch someone have poke ron in the back of the head it be malfoy oh sorry weasley didn't see you there malfoy grin broadly at crabbe and goyle wonder how long potter's go to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasley ron didn't answer snape have just award hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley have hit a bludger at him hermione who have all her finger cross in her lap be squint fixedly at harry who be circle the game like a hawk look for the snitch you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team say malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape award hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all it's people they feel sorry for see there's potter who's get no parent then there's the weasleys who've get no money—you should be on the team longbottom you've get no brain neville go bright red but turn in his seat to face malfoy i'm worth twelve of you malfoy he stammer malfoy crabbe and goyle howl with laughter but ron still not dare to take his eye from the game say you tell him neville longbottom if brain be gold you'd be poorer than weasley and that's say something ron's nerve be already stretch to the break point with anxiety about harry i'm warn you malfoy—one more word ron say hermione suddenly harry  what where harry have suddenly go into a spectacular dive which draw gasp and cheer from the crowd hermione stand up her cross finger in her mouth as harry streak toward the grind like a bullet you're in luck weasley potter's obviously spot some money on the grind say malfoy ron snap before malfoy know what be happen ron be on top of him wrestle him to the grind neville hesitate then clamber over the back of his seat to help come on harry hermione scream leap onto her seat to watch as harry speed straight at snape—she didn't even notice malfoy and ron roll around under her seat or the scuffle and yelp come from the whirl of fists that be neville crabbe and goyle up in the air snape turn on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him miss him by inches—the next second harry have pull out of the dive his arm raise in triumph the snitch clasp in his hand the stand erupt it have to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch be catch so quickly ron ron where be you the game's over harry's win we've win gryffindor be in the lead shriek hermione dance up and down on her seat and hug parvati patil in the row in front harry jump off his broom a foot from the grind he couldn't believe it he'd do it—the game be over it have barely last five minutes as gryffindors come spill onto the field he saw snape land nearby white-faced and tight-lipped—then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and look up into dumbledore's smile face well do say dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear nice to see you haven't be brood about that mirror be keep busy excellent snape spat bitterly on the grind harry leave the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldn't ever remember feel happier he'd really do something to be proud of now—no one could say he be just a famous name any more the even air have never smell so sweet he walk over the damp grass relive the last hour in his head which be a happy blur gryffindors run to lift him onto their shoulder ron and hermione in the distance jump up and down ron cheer through a heavy nosebleed harry have reach the shed he lean against the wooden door and look up at hogwarts with its windows glow red in the set sun gryffindor in the lead he'd do it he'd show snape and speak of snape a hood figure come swiftly down the front step of the castle clearly not want to be see it walk as fast as possible toward the forbid forest harry's victory fade from his mind as he watch he recognize the figure's prowl walk snape sneak into the forest while everyone else be at dinner—what be go on harry jump back on his nimbus two thousand and take off glide silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he follow the tree be so thick he couldn't see where snape have go he fly in circle lower and lower brush the top branch of tree until he hear voice he glide toward them and land noiselessly in a tower beech tree he climb carefully along one of the branch hold tight to his broomstick try to see through the leave below in a shadowy clear stand snape but he wasn't alone quirrell be there too harry couldn't make out the look on his face but he be stutter worse than ever harry strain to catch what they be say d-don't know why you want t-t-to meet here of all p-places severus oh i think we'd keep this private say snape his voice icy students aren't suppose to know about the sorcerer's stone after all harry lean forward quirrell be mumble something snape interrupt him have you find out how to get past that beast of hagrid's yet b-b-but severus i  you don't want me as your enemy quirrell say snape take a step toward him i-i don't know what you you know perfectly well what i mean an owl hoot loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steady himself in time to hear snape say  your little bite of hocus-pocus i'm wait b-but i d-d-don't  very well snape cut in we'll have another little chat soon when you've have time to think things over and decide where your loyalties lie he throw his cloak over his head and stride out of the clear it be almost dark now but harry could see quirrell stand quite still as though he be petrify harry where have you be hermione squeak we win you win we win shout ron thump harry on the back and i give malfoy a black eye and neville try to take on crabbe and goyle single-handed he's still out cold but madam pomftey say he'll be all right—talk about show slytherin everyone's wait for you in the common room we're have a party fred and george steal some cake and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now say harry breathlessly let's find an empty room you wait til you hear this he make sure peeve wasn't inside before shut the door behind them then he tell them what he'd see and hear so we be right it be the sorcerer's stone and snape's try to force quirrell to help him get it he ask if he know how to get past fluffy—and he say something about quirrell's hocus pocuss i reckon there be other things guard the stone apart from fluffy load of enchantments probably and quirrell would have do some anti-dark arts spell that snape need to break through  so you mean the stone's only safe as long as quirrell stand up to snape say hermione in alarm it'll be go by next tuesday say ron chapter fourteen norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have be braver than they'd think in the weeks that follow he do seem to be get paler and thinner but it didn't look as though he'd crack yet every time they pass the third-floor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy be still growl inside snape be sweep about in his usual bad temper which surely mean that the stone be still safe whenever harry pass quirrell these days he give him an encourage sort of smile and ron have start tell people off for laugh at quirrell's stutter hermione however have more on her mind than the sorcerer's stone she have start draw up study schedule and colorcoding all her note harry and ron wouldn't have mind but she keep nag them to do the same hermione the exams be age away ten weeks

to be think along the same line as hermione they pile so much homework on them that the easter holiday weren't nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it be hard to relax with hermione next to you recite the twelve use of dragon's blood or practice wand movements moan and yawn harry and ron spend most of their free time in the library with her try to get through all their extra work i'll never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throw down his quill and look longingly out of the library window it be the first really fine day they'd have in months the sky be a clear forget-me-not blue

harry whisper malfoy be only a few feet away and he have stop dead to listen how much have he hear harry didn't like the look on malfoy's face at all ron and hermione argue all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agree to run down to hagrid's with the other two during morning break when the bell sound from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them drop their trowel at once and hurry through the ground to the edge of the forest hagrid greet them look flush and excite it's nearly out he usher them inside the egg be lie on the table there be deep crack in it something be move inside a funny click noise be come from it they all draw their chair up to the table and watch with bat breath all at once there be a scrap noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flop onto

charlie he say you're lose it too say ron i'm ron remember no—charlie—your brother charlie in romania study dragons we could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant say ron how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agree that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him the follow week drag by wednesday night find hermione and harry sit alone in the common room long after everyone else have go to bed the clock on the wall have just chime midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appear out of nowhere as he pull off harry's

their head together to read the note dear ron how be you thank for the letter—i'd be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it won't be easy get him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who be come to visit me next week trouble be they mustn't be see carry an illegal dragon could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark send me an answer as soon as possible love charlie they look at one another we've get the invisibility cloak say harry it shouldn't be too difficult—i think the cloak big enough to cover two of us and norbert it be a mark of how bad the last week have be that the other two agree with him anything to get rid of norbert—and malfoy there be a hitch by the next morning ron's bite hand have swell to twice its usual size he didn't know whether it be safe to go to madam pomfrey—would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he have no choice the cut have turn a nasty shade of green it look as if norbert's fangs be poisonous harry and hermione rush up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed it's not just my hand he whisper although that feel like it's about to fall off malfoy tell madam pomfrey he want to borrow one of my book so he could come and have a good laugh at me he keep threaten to tell her what really bite me—i've tell her it be a dog but i don't think she believe me i shouldn't have hit him at the quidditch match that's why he's do this harry and hermione try to calm ron down it'll all be over at midnight on saturday say hermione but this didn't soothe ron at all on the contrary he sit bolt upright and break into a sweat midnight on saturday he say in a hoarse voice oh no oh no—i've just remembered—charlie's letter be in that book malfoy take he's go to know we're get rid of norbert harry and hermione didn't get a chance to answer madam pomfrey come over at that moment and make them leave say ron need sleep it's too late to change the plan now harry tell hermione we haven't get time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert we'll have to risk it and we have get the invisibility cloak malfoy doesn't know about that they find fang the boarhound sit outside with a bandage tail when they go to tell hagrid who open a window to talk to them i won't let you in he puff norbert's at a tricky stage—nothin i can't handle when they tell him about charlie's letter his eye fill with tear although that might have be because norbert have just bite him on the leg aargh it's all right he only get my boot—jus playin'—he's only a baby after all the baby bang its tail on the wall make the windows rattle harry and hermione walk back to the castle feel saturday couldn't come quickly enough they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time come for him to say good-bye to norbert if they hadn't be so worry about what they have to do it be a very dark cloudy night and they be a bite late arrive at hagrid's hut because they'd have to wait for peeve to get out of their way in the entrance hall where he'd be play tennis against the wall hagrid have norbert pack and ready in a large crate he's get lot o rat an some brandy fer the journey say hagrid in a muffle voice an i've pack his teddy bear in case he get lonely from inside the crate come rip noise that sound to harry as though the teddy be have his head tear off bye-bye norbert hagrid sob as harry and hermione cover the crate with the invisibility cloak and step underneath it themselves mommy will never forget you how they manage to get the crate back up to the castle they never know midnight tick nearer as they heave norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another—even one of harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier nearly there harry pant as they reach the corridor beneath the tallest tower then a sudden movement ahead of them make them almost drop the crate forget that they be already invisible they shrink into the shadow star at the dark outline of two people grapple with each other ten feet away a lamp flare professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net have malfoy by the ear detention she shout and twenty point from slytherin wander around in the middle of the night how dare you  you don't understand professor harry potter's coming—he's get a dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lie come on—i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seem the easiest thing in the world after that not until they'd step out into the cold night air do they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione do a sort of jig malfoy's get detention i could sing don't harry advise her chuckle about malfoy they wait norbert thrash about in his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks come swoop down out of the darkness charlie's friends be a cheery lot they show harry and hermione the harness they'd rig up so they could suspend norbert between them they all help buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shake hand with the others and thank them very much at last norbert be go go go they slip back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hand now that norbert be off them no more dragon—malfoy in detention—what could spoil their happiness the answer to that be wait at the foot of the stairs as they step into the corridor filch's face loom suddenly out of the darkness well well well he whisper we be in trouble they'd leave the invisibility cloak on top of the tower chapter fifteen the foribidden forest things couldn't have be worse filch take them down to professor mcgonagall's study on the first floor where they sit and wait without say a word to each other hermione be tremble excuse alibi and wild coverup stories chase each other around harry's brain each more feeble than the last he couldn't see how they be go to get out of trouble this time they be corner how could they have be so stupid as to forget the cloak there be no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their be out of bed and creep around the school in the dead of night let alone be up the tallest astronomy tower which be out-of-bounds except for class add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be pack their bag already have harry think that things couldn't have be worse he be wrong when professor mcgonagall appear she be lead neville harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i be try to find you to warn you i hear malfoy say he be go to catch you he say you have a drag  harry shake his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall have see she look more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she tower over the three of them i would never have believe it of any of you mr filch say you be up in the astronomy tower it's one o'clock in the morning explain yourselves it be the first time hermione have ever fail to answer a teacher's question she be star at her slippers as still as a statue i think i've get a good idea of what's be go on say professor mcgonagall it doesn't take a genius to work it out you feed draco malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon try to get him out of bed and into trouble i've already catch him i suppose you think it's funny that longbottom here hear the story and believe it too harry catch neville's eye and try to tell him without word that this wasn't true because neville be look stun and hurt poor blunder neville—harry know what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them i'm disgust say professor mcgonagall four students out of bed in one night i've never hear of such a thing before you miss granger i think you have more sense as for you mr potter i think gryffindor mean more to you than this all three of you will receive detentions—yes you too mr longbottom nothing give you the right to walk around school at night especially these days it's very dangerous—and fifty point will be take from gryffindor fifty harry gasped—they would lose the lead the lead he'd win in the last quidditch match fifty point each say professor mcgonagall breathe heavily through her long point nose professor—please you can't  don't tell me what i can and can't do potter now get back to bed all of you i've never be more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty point lose that put gryffindor in last place in one night they'd ruin any chance gryffindor have have for the house cup harry felt as though the bottom have drop out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didn't sleep all night he could hear neville sob into his pillow for what seem like hours harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him he know neville like himself be dread the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor find out what they'd do at first gryffindors pass the giant hourglasses that record the house point the next day think there'd be a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty point fewer than yesterday and then the story start to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch match have lo st them all those point him and a couple of other stupid first years from be one of the most popular and admire people at the school harry be suddenly the most hat even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turn on him because everyone have be long to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry go people point and didn't trouble to lower their voice as they insult him slytherins on the other hand clap as he walk past them whistle and cheer thank potter we owe you one only ron stand by him they'll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lose load of point in all the time they've be here and people still like them they've never lose a hundred and fifty point in one go though have they say harry miserably well—no ron admit it be a bite late to repair the damage but harry swear to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on he'd have it with sneak around and spy he felt so ashamed of himself that he go to wood and offer to resign from the quidditch team resign wood thunder what good'll that do how be we go to get any point back if we can't win at quidditch but even quidditch have lose its fun the rest of the team wouldn't speak to harry during practice and if they have to speak about him they call him the seeker hermione and neville be suffer too they didn't have as bad a time as harry because they weren't as well-known but nobody would speak to them either hermione have stop draw attention to herself in class keep her head down and work in silence harry be almost glad that the exams weren't far away all the study he have to do keep his mind off his misery he ron and hermione keep to themselves work late into the night try to remember the ingredients in complicate potions learn charm and spell by heart memorize the date of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions then about a week before the exams be due to start harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him be put to an unexpected test walk back from the library on his own one afternoon he hear somebody whimper from a classroom up ahead as he draw closer he hear quirrell's voice no—no—not again please  it sound as though someone be threaten him harry move closer all right—all right  he hear quirrell sob next second quirrell come hurry out of the classroom straighten his turban he be pale and look as though he be about to cry he stride out of sight harry didn't think quirrell have even notice him he wait until quirrell's footsteps have disappear then peer into the classroom it be empty but a door stand ajar at the other end harry be halfway toward it before he remember what he'd promise himself about not meddle all the same he'd have gamble twelve sorcerer's stone that snape have just leave the room and from what harry have just hear snape would be walk with a new spring in his step—quirrell seem to have give in at last harry go back to the library where hermione be test ron on astronomy harry tell them what he'd hear snape's do it then say ron if quirrell's tell him how to break his anti-dark force spell  there's still fluffy though say hermione maybe snape's find out how to get past him without ask hagrid say ron look up at the thousands of book surround them i bet there's a book somewhere in here tell you how to get past a giant three-headed dog so what do we do harry the light of adventure be kindle again in ron's eye but hermione answer before harry could go to dumbledore that's what we should have do age ago if we try anything ourselves we'll be throw out for sure but we've get no proof say harry quirrell's too scar to back us up snape's only get to say he doesn't know how the troll get in at halloween and that he be nowhere near the third floor—who do you think they'll believe him or us it's not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledore'll think we make it up to get him sack filch wouldn't help us if his life depend on it he's too friendly with snape and the more students get throw out the better he'll think and don't forget we're not suppose to know about the stone or fluffy that'll take a lot of explain hermione look convince but ron didn't if we just do a bite of poke around  no say harry flatly we've do enough poke around he pull a map of jupiter toward him and start to learn the name of its moon the follow morning note be deliver to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they be all the same your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hall professor mcgonagall harry have forget they still have detentions to do in the furor over the point they'd lose he half expect hermione to complain that this be a whole night of study lose but she didn't say a word like harry she felt they deserve what they'd get at eleven o'clock that night they say good-bye to ron in the common room and go down to the entrance hall with neville filch be already there—and so be malfoy harry have also forget that malfoy have get a detention too follow me say filch light a lamp and lead them outside i bet you'll think twice about break a school rule again won't you eh he say leer at them oh yes hard work and pain be the best

they're ever need right off we go and don't think of run off now it'll be worse for you if you do they march off across the dark ground neville keep sniff harry wonder what their punishment be go to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldn't be sound so delight the moon be bright but cloud scud across it keep throw them into darkness ahead harry could see the light windows of hagrid's hut then they hear a distant shout be that you filch hurry up i want ter get start harry's heart rise if they be go to be work with hagrid it wouldn't be so bad his relief must have show in his face because filch say i suppose you think you'll be enjoy yourself with that oaf well think again boy—it's into the forest you're go and i'm much mistake if you'll all come out in one piece at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stop dead in his track the forest he repeat and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual we can't go in there at night—there's all sort of things in there—werewolves i hear neville clutch the sleeve of harry's robe and make a choke noise that's your problem isn't it say filch his voice crack with glee should've think of them werewolves before you get in trouble shouldn't you hagrid come stride toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he be carry his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hang over his shoulder abou time he say i bin waitin

don want no one takin risk follow me over here a moment he lead them to the very edge of the forest hold his lamp up high he point down a narrow wind earth track that disappear into the thick black tree a light breeze lift their hair as they look into the forest look there say hagrid see that stuff shinin on the grind silvery stuff that's unicorn blood there's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this be the second time in a week i find one dead last wednesday we're gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn find

right get yer wands out an practice now—that's it—an if anyone get in trouble send up red spark an we'll all come an find yeh—so be careful—let's go the forest be black and silent a little way into it they reach a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid take the leave path while malfoy neville and fang take the right they walk in silence their eye on the grind every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branch above light a spot of silver-blue blood on the fall leave harry saw that hagrid look very worry could a werewolf be kill the unicorns harry ask not fast enough say hagrid it's not easy ter catch a unicorn they're powerful magic creatures i never know one ter be hurt before they walk past a mossy tree stump harry could hear run water there must be a stream somewhere close by there be still spot of unicorn blood here and there along the wind path you all right hermione hagrid whisper don worry it can't've go far if it's this badly hurt an then we'll be able ter—get behind that tree hagrid seize harry and hermione and hoist them off the path behind a tower oak he pull out an arrow and fit it into his crossbow raise it ready to fire the three of them listen something be slither over dead leave nearby it sound like a cloak trail along the grind hagrid be squint up the dark path but after a few second the sound fade away i know it  he murmur there's summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggest that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither say hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walk more slowly ears strain for the faintest sound suddenly in a clear ahead something definitely move who's there hagrid call show yerself—i'm arm and into the clear came—was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that be a horse's gleam chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermione's jaw drop oh it's you ronan say hagrid in relief how be yeh he walk forward and shake the centaur's hand good even to you hagrid say ronan he have a deep sorrowful voice be you go to shoot me can't be too careful ronan say hagrid pat his crossbow there's summat bad loose in this forest this be harry potter an hermione granger by the way students up at the school an this be ronan you two he's a centaur we'd notice say hermione faintly good even say ronan students be you and do you learn much up at the school erm  a bite say hermione timidly a bite well that's something ronan sigh he fling back his head and star at the sky mar be bright tonight yeah say hagrid glance up too listen i'm glad we've run inter yeh ronan cause there's a unicorn bin hurt—you see anythin ronan didn't answer immediately he star unblinkingly upward then sigh again always the innocent be the first victims he say so it

meanin anythin unusual a bite nearer home say hagrid so yeh haven't notice anythin strange yet again ronan take a while to answer at last he say the forest hide many secrets a movement in the tree behind ronan make hagrid raise his bow again but it be only a second centaur black-haired and body and wilder-looking than ronan hullo bane say hagrid all right good even hagrid i hope you be well well enough look i've jus bin askin ronan you see anythin odd in here lately there's a unicorn bin injured—would yeh know anythin about it bane walk over to stand next to ronan he look skyward mar be bright tonight he say simply we've hear say hagrid grumpily well if either of you do see anythin let me know won't yeh we'll be off then harry and hermione follow him out of the clear star over their shoulder at ronan and bane until the tree block their view never say hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not interest in anythin closer'n the moon be there many of them in here ask hermione oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but they're good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word they're deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much d'you think that be a centaur we hear earlier say harry do that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask me that be what's bin killin the unicorns—never hear anythin like it before they walk on through the dense dark tree harry keep look nervously over his shoulder he have the nasty feel they be be watch he be very glad they have hagrid and his crossbow with them they have just pass a bend in the path when hermione grab hagrid's arm hagrid look red spark the others be in trouble you two wait here hagrid shout stay on the path i'll come back for yeh they hear him crash away through the undergrowth and stand look at each other very scar until they couldn't hear anything but the rustle of leave around them you don't think they've be hurt do you whisper hermione i don't care if malfoy have but if something's get neville it's our fault he's here in the first place the minutes drag by their ears seem sharper than usual harry's seem to be pick up every sigh of the wind every crack twig what be go on where be the others at last a great crunch noise announce hagrid's return malfoy neville and fang be with him hagrid be fume malfoy it seem have sneak up behind neville and grab him as a joke neville have panic and send up the spark we'll be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two be makin right we're changin groups—neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot i'm sorry hagrid add in a whisper to harry but he'll have a harder time frightenin you an we've gotta get this do so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walk for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path become almost impossible to follow because the tree be so thick harry think the blood seem to be get thicker there be splash on the root of a tree as though the poor creature have be thrash around in pain close by harry could see a clear ahead through the tangle branch of an ancient oak look  he murmur hold out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white be gleam on the grind they inch closer it be the unicorn all right and it be dead harry have never see anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs be stick out at odd angle where it have fall and its mane be spread pearly-white on the dark leave harry have take one step toward it when a slither sound make him freeze where he stand a bush on the edge of the clear quiver then out of the shadow a hood figure come crawl across the grind like some stalk beast harry malfoy and fang stand transfix the cloak figure reach the unicorn lower its head over the wind in the animal's side and begin to drink its blood aaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted—so do fang the hood figure raise its head and look right at harry—unicorn blood be dribble down its front it get to its feet and come swiftly toward harry—he couldn't move for fear then a pain like he'd never felt before pierce his head it be as though his scar be on fire half blind he stagger backward he hear hooves behind him gallop and something jump clean over harry charge at the figure the pain in harry's head be so bad he fell to his knees it take a minute or two to pass when he look up the figure have go a centaur be stand over him not ronan or bane this one look younger he have white-blond hair and a palomino body be you all right say the centaur pull harry to his feet yes—thank you—what be that the centaur didn't answer he have astonishingly blue eye like pale sapphires he look carefully at harry his eye linger on the scar that stand out livid on harry's forehead you be the potter boy he say you have better get back to hagrid the forest be not safe at this time—especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name be firenze he add as he lower himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back there be suddenly a sound of more gallop from the other side of the clear ronan and bane come burst through the tree their flank heave and sweaty firenze bane thunder what be you do you have a human on your back have you no shame be you a common mule do you realize who this be say firenze this be the potter boy the quicker he leave this forest the better what have you be tell him growl bane remember firenze we be swear not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what be to come in the movements of the planets ronan paw the grind nervously i'm sure firenze think he be act for the best  he say in his gloomy voice bane kick his back legs in anger for the best what be that to do with us centaurs be concern with what have be foretell it be not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly rear on to his hind legs in anger so that harry have to grab his shoulder to stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellow at bane do you not understand why it be kill or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what be lurk in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisk around with harry clutch on as best he could they plunge off into the tree leave ronan and bane behind them harry didn't have a clue what be go on why's bane so angry he ask what be that thing you save me from anyway firenze slow to a walk warn harry to keep his head bow in case of low-hanging branch but do not answer harry's question they make their way through the tree in silence for so long that harry think firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore they be pass through a particularly dense patch of tree however when firenze suddenly stop harry potter do you know what unicorn blood be use for no say harry startle by the odd question we've only use the horn and tail hair in potions that be because it be a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn say firenze only one who have nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you be an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slay something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a half-life a curse life from the moment the blood touch your lips harry star at the back of firenze's head which be dapple silver in the moonlight but who'd be that desperate he wonder aloud if you're go to be curse forever deaths better isn't it it be firenze agree unless all you need be to stay alive long enough to drink something else—something that will bring you back to full strength and power—something that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what be hide in the school at this very moment the sorcerer's stone of course—the elixir of life but i don't understand who  can you think of nobody who have wait many years to return to power who have cling to life await their chance it be as though an iron fist have clench suddenly around harry's heart over the rustle of the tree he seem to hear once more what hagrid have tell him on the night they have meet some say he die codswallop in my opinion dunno if he have enough human leave in him to die do you mean harry croak that be vol harry harry be you all right hermione be run toward them down the path hagrid puff along behind her i'm fine say harry hardly know what he be say the unicorn's dead hagrid it's in that clear back there this be where i leave you firenze murmur as hagrid hurry off to examine the unicorn you be safe now harry slide off his back good luck harry potter say firenze the planets have be read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this be one of those time he turn and canter back into the depths of the forest leave harry shiver behind him ron have fall asleep in the dark common room wait for them to return he shout something about quidditch foul when harry roughly shake him awake in a matter of second though he be wide-eyed as harry begin to tell him and hermione what have happen in the forest harry couldn't sit down he pace up and down in front of the fire he be still shake snape want the stone for voldemort and voldemort's wait in the forest and all this time we think snape just want to get rich stop say the name say ron in a terrify whisper as if he think voldemort could hear them harry wasn't listen firenze save me but he shouldn't have do so bane be furious he be talk about interfere with what the planets say be go to happen they must show that voldemort's come back bane think firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose that's write in the star as well will you stop say the name ron hiss so all i've get to wait for now be snape to steal the stone harry go on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose bane'll be happy hermione look very frighten but she have a word of comfort harry everyone say dumbledore's the only one you-know-who be ever afraid of with dumbledore around you-know-who won't touch you anyway who say the centaurs be right it sound like fortune-telling to me and professor mcgonagall say that's a very imprecise branch of magic the sky have turn light before they stop talk they go to bed exhaust their throats sore but the night's surprise weren't over when harry pull back his sheet he find his invisibility cloak fold neatly underneath them there be a note pin to it just in case chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he have manage to get through his exams when he half expect voldemort to come burst through the door at any moment yet the days creep by and there could be no doubt that fluffy be still alive and well behind the lock door it be swelter hot especially in the large classroom where they do their write paper they have be give special new quills for the exams which have be bewitch with an anticheating spell they have practical exams as well professor flitwick call them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watch them turn a mouse into a snuffbox—points be give for how pretty the snuffbox be but take away if it have whisker snape make them all nervous breathe down their neck while they try to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion harry do the best he could try to ignore the stab pain in his forehead which have be bother him ever since his trip into the forest neville think harry have a bad case of exam nerve because harry couldn't sleep but the truth be that harry keep be wake by his old nightmare except that it be now worse than ever because there be a hood figure drip blood in it maybe it be because they hadn't see what harry have see in the forest or because they didn't have scar burn on their foreheads but ron and hermione didn't seem as worry about the stone as harry the idea of voldemort certainly scar them but he didn't keep visit them in dream and they be so busy with their study they didn't have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to their very last exam be history of magic one hour of answer question about batty old wizards who'd invent selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam result come out when the ghost of professor binns tell them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldn't help cheer with the rest that be far easier than i think it would be say hermione as they join the crowd flock out onto the sunny ground i needn't have learn about the 1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprise of elfric the eager hermione always like to go through their exam paper afterward but ron say this make him feel ill so they wander down to the lake and flop under a tree the weasley twin and lee jordan be tickle the tentacles of a giant squid which be bask in the warm shallow no more study ron sigh happily stretch out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry we've get a week before we find out how badly we've do there's no need to worry yet harry be rub his forehead i wish i know what this mean he burst out angrily my scar keep hurting—it's happen before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggest i'm not ill say harry i think it's a warn it mean danger's come ron couldn't get work up it be too hot harry relax hermione's right the stone's safe as long as dumbledore's around anyway we've never have any proof snape find out how to get past fluffy he nearly have his leg rip off once he's not go to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid let dumbledore down harry nod but he couldn't shake off a lurk feel that there be something he'd forget to do something important when he try to explain this hermione say that's just the exams i wake up last night and be halfway through my transfiguration note before i remember we'd do that one harry be quite sure the unsettle feel didn't have anything to do with work though he watch an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamp in its mouth hagrid be the only one who ever send him letter hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but  harry suddenly jump to his feet where're you go say ron sleepily i've just think of something say harry he have turn white we've get to go and see hagrid now why pant hermione hurry to keep up don't you think it's a bite odd say harry scramble up the grassy slope that what hagrid want more than anything else be a dragon and a stranger turn up who just happen to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon egg if it's against wizard law lucky they find hagrid don't you think why didn't i see it before what be you talk about say ron but harry sprint across the ground toward the forest didn't answer hagrid be sit in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves be roll up and he be shell peas into a large bowl hullo he say smile finish yer exams get time fer a drink yes please say ron but harry cut him off no we're in a hurry hagrid i've get to ask you something you know that night you win norbert what do the stranger you be play card with look like dunno say hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stun and raise his eyebrows it's not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hog's head—that's the pub down in the village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i never saw his face he keep his hood up harry sink down next to the bowl of peas what do you talk to him about hagrid do you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up say hagrid frown as he try to remember yeah he ask what i do an i tell him i be gamekeeper here he ask a bite about the sorta creatures i take

percent on his exam they're not throw me out after that after dinner the three of them sit nervously apart in the common room nobody bother them none of the gryffindors have anything to say to harry any more after all this be the first night he hadn't be upset by it hermione be skim through all her note hop to come across one of the enchantments they be about to try to break harry and ron didn't talk much both of them be think about what they be about to do slowly the room empty as people drift off to bed better get the cloak ron mutter as lee jordan finally leave stretch and yawn harry run upstairs to their dark dormitory he putt out the cloak and then his eye fell on the flute hagrid have give him for christmas he pocket it to use on fluffy—he didn't feel much like sing he run back down to the common room we'd better put the cloak on here and make sure it cover all three of us—if filch spot one of our feet wander along on its own  what be you do say a voice from the corner of the room neville appear from behind an armchair clutch trevor the toad who look as though he'd be make another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing say harry hurriedly put the cloak behind his back neville star at their guilty face you're go out again he say no no no say hermione no we're not why don't you go to bed neville harry look at the grandfather clock by the door they couldn't afford to waste any more time snape might even now be play fluffy to sleep you can't go out say neville you'll be catch again gryffindor will be in even more trouble you don't understand say harry this be important but neville be clearly steel himself to do something desperate i won't let you do it he say hurry to stand in front of the portrait hole i'll—i'll fight you neville ron explode get away from that hole and don't be an idiot  don't you call me an idiot say neville i don't think you should be break any more rule and you be the one who tell me to stand up to people yes but not to us say ron in exasperation neville you don't know what you're do he take a step forward and neville drop trevor the toad who leap out of sight go on then try and hit me say neville raise his fists i'm ready harry turn to hermione do something he say desperately hermione step forward neville she say i'm really really sorry about this she raise her wand petrificus totalus she cry point it at neville neville's arm snap to his side his legs spring together his whole body rigid he sway where he stand and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board hermione run to turn him over neville's jaw be jam together so he couldn't speak only his eye be move look at them in horror what've you do to him harry whisper it's the full body-bind say hermione miserably oh neville i'm so sorry we have to neville no time to explain say harry you'll understand later neville say ron as they step over him and pull on the invisibility cloak but leave neville lie motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statue's shadow look like filch every distant breath of wind sound like peeve swoop down on them at the foot of the first set of stairs they spot mrs norris skulk near the top oh let's kick her just this once ron whisper in harry's ear but harry shake his head as they climb carefully around her mrs norris turn her lamplike eye on them but didn't do anything they didn't meet anyone else until they reach the staircase up to the third floor peeve be bob halfway up loosen the carpet so that people would trip who's there he say suddenly as they climb toward him he narrow his wicked black eye know you're there even if i can't see you be you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rise up in the air and float there squint at them should call filch i should if something's a-creeping around unseen harry have a sudden idea peeve he say in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron have his own reason for be invisible peeve almost fell out of the air in shock he catch himself in time and hover about a foot off the stairs so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he say greasily my mistake my mistake—i didn't see you—of course i didn't you're invisible—forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeve croak harry stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will say peeve rise up in the air again hope your business go well baron i'll not bother you and he scoot off brilliant harry whisper ron a few second later they be there outside the third-floor corridor—and the door be already ajar well there you be harry say quietly snape's already get past fluffy see the open door somehow seem to impress upon all three of them what be face them underneath the cloak harry turn to the other two if you want to go back i won't blame you he say you can take the cloak i won't need it now don't be stupid say ron we're come say hermione harry push the door open as the door creak low rumble growl meet their ears all three of the dog's nose sniff madly in their direction even though it couldn't see them what's that at its feet hermione whisper look like a harp say ron snape must have leave it there it must wake up the moment you stop play say harry well here go he put hagrid's flute to his lips and blow it wasn't really a tune but from the first note the beast's eye begin to droop harry hardly draw breath slowly the dog's growl ceased—it totter on its paw and fell to its knees then it slump to the grind fast asleep keep play ron warn harry as they slip out of the cloak and creep toward the trapdoor they could feel the dog's hot smelly breath as they approach the giant head i think we'll be able to pull the door open say ron peer over the dog's back want to go first hermione no i don't all right ron grit his teeth and step carefully over the dog's legs he bend and pull the ring of the trapdoor which swing up and open what can you see hermione say anxiously nothing—just black—there's no way of climb down we'll just have to drop harry who be still play the flute wave at ron to get his attention and point at himself you want to go first be you sure say ron i don't know how deep this thing go give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry hand the flute over in the few second silence the dog growl and twitch but the moment hermione begin to play it fell back into its deep sleep harry climb over it and look down through the trapdoor there be no sign of the bottom he lower himself through the hole until he be hang on by his fingertips then he look up at ron and say if anything happen to me don't follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right say ron see you in a minute i hope and harry let go cold damp air rush past him as he fell down down down and—flump with a funny muffle sort of thump he land on something soft he sit up and felt around his eye not use to the gloom it felt as though he be sit on some sort of plant it's okay he call up to the light the size of a postage stamp which be the open trapdoor it's a soft land you can jump ron follow right away he land sprawl next to harry what's this stuff be his first word dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose it's here to break the fall come on hermione the distant music stop there be a loud bark from the dog but hermione have already jump she land on harry's other side we must be miles under the school she say lucky this plant thing's here really say ron lucky shriek hermione look at you both she leap up and struggle toward a damp wall she have to struggle because the moment she have land the plant have start to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for harry and ron their legs have already be bind tightly in long creepers without their notice hermione have manage to free herself before the plant get a firm grip on her now she watch in horror as the two boys fight to pull the plant off them but the more they strain against it the tighter and faster the plant wind around them stop move hermione order them i know what this is—it's devil's snare oh i'm so glad we know what it's call that's a great help snarl ron lean back try to stop the plant from curl around his neck shut up i'm try to remember how to kill it say hermione well hurry up i can't breathe harry gasp wrestle with it as it curl around his chest devil's snare devil's snare what do professor sprout say?—it like the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choke yes—of course—but there's no wood hermione cry wring her hand have you go mad ron bellow be you a witch or not oh right say hermione and she whip out her wand wave it mutter something and send a jet of the same bluebell flame she have use on snape at the plant in a matter of second the two boys felt it loosen its grip as it cringe away from the light and warmth wriggle and flail it unravel itself from their body and they be able to pull free lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione say harry as he join her by the wall wipe sweat off his face yeah say ron and lucky harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis—'there's no wood honestly this way say harry point down a stone passageway which be the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footsteps be the gentle drip of water trickle down the wall the passageway slop downward and harry be remind of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remember the dragons say to be guard vault in the wizards bank if they meet a dragon a fully-grown dragon—norbert have be bad enough can you hear something ron whisper harry listen a soft rustle and clink seem to be come from up ahead do you think it's a ghost i don't know sound like wing to me there's light ahead—i can see something move they reach the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly light chamber its ceiling arch high above them it be full of small jewel-bright bird flutter and tumble all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber be a heavy wooden door do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room say ron probably say harry they don't look very vicious but i suppose if they all swoop down at once well there's no other choice i'll run he take a deep breath cover his face with his arm and sprint across the room he expect to feel sharp beak and claw tear at him any second but nothing happen he reach the door untouched he pull the handle but it be lock the other two follow him they tug and heave at the door but it wouldn't budge not even when hermione try her alohomora charm now what say ron these bird they can't be here just for decoration say hermione they watch the bird soar overhead glittering—glittering they're not bird harry say suddenly they're key wing keys—look carefully so that must mean he look around the chamber while the other two squint up at the flock of key yes—look broomsticks we've get to catch the key to the door but there be hundreds of them ron examine the lock on the door we're look for a big old-fashioned one—probably silver like the handle they each seize a broomstick and kick off into the air soar into the midst of the cloud of key they grab and snatch but the bewitch key dart and dive so quickly it be almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though be harry the youngest seeker in a century he have a knack for spot things other people didn't after a minute's weave about through the whirl of rainbow feather he notice a large silver key that have a bend wing as if it have already be catch and stuff roughly into the keyhole that one he call to the others that big one—there—no there—with bright blue wings—the feather be all crumple on one side ron go speed in the direction that harry be point crash into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom we've get to close in on it harry call not take his eye off the key with the damage wing ron you come at it from above—hermione stay below and stop it from go down and i'll try and catch it right now ron dive hermione rocket upward the key dodge them both and harry streak after it it speed toward the wall harry lean forward and with a nasty crunch noise pin it against the stone with one hand ron and hermione's cheer echo around the high chamber they land quickly and harry run to the door the key struggle in his hand he ram it into the lock and turned—it work the moment the lock have click open the key take flight again look very batter now that it have be catch twice ready harry ask the other two his hand on the door handle they nod he pull the door open the next chamber be so dark they couldn't see anything at all but as they step into it light suddenly flood the room to reveal an astonish sight they be stand on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which be all taller than they be and carve from what look like black stone face them way across the chamber be the white piece harry ron and hermione shiver slightly—the tower white chessmen have no face now what do we do harry whisper it's obvious isn't it say ron we've get to play our way across the room behind the white piece they could see another door how say hermione nervously i think say ron we're go to have to be chessmen he walk up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse at once the stone spring to life the horse paw the grind and the knight turn his helmeted head to look down at ron do we—er—have to join you to get across the black knight nod ron turn to the other two this need think about he say i suppose we've get to take the place of three of the black piece harry and hermione stay quiet watch ron think finally he say now don't be offend or anything but neither of you be that good at chess  we're not offend say harry quickly just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you 90 next to him instead of that castle what about you i'm go to be a knight say ron the chessmen seem to have be listen because at these word a knight a bishop and a castle turn their back on the white piece and walk off the board leave three empty square that harry ron and hermione take white always play first in chess say ron peer across the board yes look a white pawn have move forward two square ron start to direct the black piece they move silently wherever he send them harry's knees be tremble what if they lose harry—move diagonally four square to the right their first real shock come when their other knight be take the white queen smash him to the floor and drag him off the board where he lay quite still facedown have to let that happen say ron look shake leave you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men be lose the white piece show no mercy soon there be a huddle of limp black players slump along the wall twice ron only just notice in time that harry and hermione be in danger he himself dart around the board take almost as many white piece as they have lose black ones we're nearly there he mutter suddenly let me think let me think the white queen turn her blank face toward him yes say ron softly it's the only way i've get to be take nof harry and hermione shout that's chess snap ron you've get to make some sacrifice i take one step forward and she'll take me—that leave you free to checkmate the king harry but  do you want to stop snape or not ron  look if you don't hurry up he'll already have the stone there be no alternative ready ron call his face pale but determine here i go—now don't hang around once you've win he step forward and the white queen pounce she strike ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crash to the floor—hermione scream but stay on her square—the white queen drag ron to one side he look as if he'd be knock out shake harry move three space to the leave the white king take off his crown and throw it at harry's feet they have win the chessmen part and bow leave the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charge through the door and up the next passageway what if he's  he'll be all right say harry try to convince himself what do you reckon's next we've have sprout's that be the devil's snare flitwick must've put charm on the key mcgonagall transfigure the chessmen to make them alive that leave quirrell's spell and snape's they have reach another door all right harry whisper go on harry push it open a disgust smell fill their nostrils make both of them pull their rob up over their nose eye water they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they have tackle out cold with a bloody lump on its head i'm glad we didn't have to fight that one harry whisper as they step carefully over one of its massive legs come on i can't breathe he pull open the next door both of them hardly dare to look at what come next—but there be nothing very frighten in here just a table with seven differently shape bottle stand on it in a line snape's say harry what do we have to do they step over the threshold and immediately a fire spring up behind them in the doorway it wasn't ordinary fire either it be purple at the same instant black flame shoot up in the doorway lead onward they be trap look hermione seize a roll of paper lie next to the bottle harry look over her shoulder to read it danger lie before you while safety lie behind two of us will help you which ever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us be killers wait bid in line choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clue four first however slyly the poison try to hide you will always find some on nettle wine's leave side second different be those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither be your friend third as you see clearly all be different size neither dwarf nor giant hold death in their insides fourth the second leave and the second on the right be twin once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amaze saw that she be smile the very last thing he felt like do brilliant say hermione this isn't magic—it's logic—a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizards haven't get an ounce of logic they'd be stick in here forever but so will we won't we of course not say hermione everything we need be here on this paper seven bottle three be poison two be wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several time then she walk up and down the line of bottle mutter to herself and point at them at last she clap her hand get it she say the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire—toward the stone harry look at the tiny bottle there's only enough there for one of us he say that's hardly one swallow they look at each other which one will get you back through the purple flame hermione point at a round bottle at the right end of the line you drink that say harry no listen get back and get ron grab broom from the flyingkey room they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy—go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but i'm no match for him really but harry—what if you-know-who's with him well—i be lucky once wasn't i say harry point at his scar i might get lucky again hermione's lip tremble and she suddenly dash at harry and throw her arm around him hermione harry—you're a great wizard you know i'm not as good as you say harry very embarrass as she let go of him me say hermione book and cleverness there be more important things—friendship and bravery and—oh harry—be careful you drink first say harry you be sure which be which aren't you positive say hermione she take a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shudder it's not poison say harry anxiously no—but it's like ice quick go before it wear off good luck—take care go hermione turn and walk straight through the purple fire harry take a deep breath and pick up the smallest bottle he turn to face the black flame here i come he say and he drain the little bottle in one gulp it be indeed as though ice be flood his body he put the bottle down and walk forward he brace himself saw the black flame lick his body but couldn't feel them—for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire—then he be on the other side in the last chamber there be already someone there—but it wasn't snape it wasn't even voldemort chapter seventeen the man with two face it be quirrell you gasp harry quirrell smile his face wasn't twitch at all me he say calmly i wonder whether i'd be meet you here potter but i thought—snape  severus quirrell laugh and it wasn't his usual quiver treble either but cold and sharp yes severus do seem the type doesn't he so useful to have him swoop around like an overgrow bat next to him who would suspect p-p-poor st-stuttering p-professor quirrell harry couldn't take it in this couldn't be true it couldn't but snape try to kill me no no no i try to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knock me over as she rush to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she break my eye contact with you another few second and i'd have get you off that broom i'd have manage it before then if snape hadn't be mutter a countercurse try to save you snape be try to save me of course say quirrell coolly why do you think he want to referee your next match he be try to make sure i didn't do it again funny really he needn't have bother i couldn't do anything with dumbledore watch all the other teachers think snape be try to stop gryffindor from win he do make himself unpopular and what a waste of time when after all that i'm go to kill you tonight quirrell snap his finger rope spring out of thin air and wrap themselves tightly around harry you're too nosy to live potter scurry around the school on halloween like that for all i know you'd see me come to look at what be guard the stone you let the troll in certainly i have a special gift with trolls—you must have see what i do to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else be run around look for it snape who already suspect me go straight to the third floor to head me off—and not only do my troll fail to beat you to death that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite snape's leg off properly now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interest mirror it be only then that harry realize what be stand behind quirrell it be the mirror of erised this mirror be the key to find the stone quirrell murmur tap his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but he's in london i'll be far away by the time he get back all harry could think of do be to keep quirrell talk and stop him from concentrate on the mirror i saw you and snape in the forest  he blurt out yes say quirrell idly walk around the mirror to look at the back he be on to me by that time try to find out how far i'd get he suspect me all along try to frighten me—as though he could when i have lord voldemort on my side quirrell come back out from behind the mirror and star hungrily into it i see the stone i'm present it to my master but where be it harry struggle against the rope bind him but they didn't give he have to keep quirrell from give his whole attention to the mirror but snape always seem to hate me so much oh he do say quirrell casually heavens yes he be at hogwarts with your father didn't you know they loathe each other but he never want you dead but i hear you a few days ago sobbing—i think snape be threaten you for the first time a spasm of fear flit across quirrell's face sometimes he say i find it hard to follow my master's instructions—he be a great wizard and i be weak  you mean he be there in the classroom with you harry gasp he be with me wherever i go say quirrell quietly i meet him when i travel around the world a foolish young man i be then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil lord voldemort show me how wrong i be there be no good and evil there be only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have serve him faithfully although i have let him down many time he have have to be very hard on me quirrell shiver suddenly he do not forgive mistake easily when i fail to steal the stone from gringotts he be most displease he punish me decide he would have to keep a closer watch on me quirrell's voice trail away harry be remember his trip to diagon alley how could he have be so stupid he'd see quirrell there that very day shake hand with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell curse under his breath i don't understand be the stone inside the mirror should i break it harry's mind be race what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he think be to find the stone before quirrell do so if i look in the mirror i should see myseff find it—which mean i'll see where it's hide but how can i look without quirrell realize what i'm up to he try to edge to the leave to get in front of the glass without quirrell notice but the rope around his ankles be too tight he trip and fell over quirrell ignore him he be still talk to himself what do this mirror do how do it work help me master and to harry's horror a voice answer and the voice seem to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boy quirrell round on harry yes—potter—come here he clap his hand once and the rope bind harry fell off harry get slowly to his feet come here quirrell repeat look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walk toward him i must lie he think desperately i must look and lie about what i see that's all quirrell move close behind him harry breathe in the funny smell that seem to come from quirrell's turban he close his eye step in front of the mirror and open them again he saw his reflection pale and scared-looking at first but a moment later the reflection smile at him it put its hand into its pocket and pull out a blood-red stone it wink and put the stone back in its pocket—and as it do so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow—incredibly—he'd get the stone well say quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screw up his courage i see myself shake hand with dumbledore he invent i—i've win the house cup for gryffindor quirrell curse again get out of the way he say as harry move aside he felt the sorcerer's stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadn't walk five pace before a high voice speak though quirrell wasn't move his lips he lie he lie potter come back here quirrell shout tell me the truth what do you just see the high voice speak again let me speak to him face-to-face master you be not strong enough i have strength enough for this harry felt as if devil's snare be root him to the spot he couldn't move

high with what look like half the candy shop tokens from your friends and admirers say dumbledore beam what happen down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell be a complete secret so naturally the whole school know i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley be responsible for try to send you a toilet seat no doubt they think it would amuse you madam pomfrey however

sit the stone i see you be not to be distract very well the stone professor quirrell do not manage to take it from you i arrive in time to prevent that although you be do very well on your own i must say you get there you get hermione's owl we must have cross in midair no sooner have i reach london than it become clear to me that the place i should be be the one i have just leave i arrive just in time to pull quirrell off you it be you i fear i might be too late you nearly be i couldn't have keep him off the stone much longer  not the stone boy you—the effort involve nearly kill you for one terrible moment there i be afraid it have as for the stone it have be destroy destroy say harry blankly but your friend—nicolas flamel  oh you know about nicolas say dumbledore sound quite delight you do do the thing properly didn't you well nicolas and i have have a little chat and agree it's all for the best but that mean he and his wife will die won't they they have enough elixir store to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smile at the look of amazement on harry's face to one as young as you i'm sure it seem incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really be like go to bed after a very very long day after all to the well-organized mind death be but the next great adventure you know the stone be really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human be would choose above all—the trouble be humans do have a knack of choose precisely those things that be worst for them harry lay there lose for word dumbledore hum a little and smile at the ceiling sir say harry i've be think sir—even if the stone's go vol i mean you-knowwho  call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for things fear of a name increase fear of the thing itself yes sir well voldemort's go to try other ways of come back isn't he i mean he hasn't go have he no harry he have not he be still out there somewhere perhaps look for another body to share not be truly alive he cannot be kill he leave quirrell to die he show just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delay his return to power it will merely take someone else who be prepare to fight what seem a lose battle next time—and if he be delay again and again why he may never return to power harry nod but stop quickly because it make his head hurt then he say sir there be some other things i'd like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about the truth dumbledore sigh it be a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treat with great caution however i shall answer your question unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you'll forgive me i shall not of course lie well voldemort say that he only kill my mother because she try to stop him from kill me but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sigh very deeply this time alas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you be older i know you hate to hear this when you be ready you will know and harry know it would be no good to argue but why couldn't quirrell touch me your mother die to save you if there be one thing voldemort cannot understand it be love he didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leave its own mark not a scar no visible sign to have be love so deeply even though the person who love us be go will give us some protection forever it be in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition share his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it be agony to touch a person mark by something so good dumbledore now become very interest in a bird out on the windowsill which give harry time to dry his eye on the sheet when he have find his voice again harry say and the invisibility cloak—do you know who send it to me ah—your father happen to leave it in my possession and i think you might like it dumbledore's eye twinkle useful things your father use it mainly for sneak off to the kitchens to steal food when he be here and there's something else fire away quirrell say snape  professor snape harry yes him—quirrell say he hat me because he hat my father be that true well they do rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father do something snape could never forgive what he save his life what yes say dumbledore dreamily funny the way people's mind work isn't it professor snape couldn't bear be in your father's debt i do believe he work so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hat your father's memory in peace harry try to understand this but it make his head pound so he stop and sir there's one more thing just the one how do i get the stone out of the mirror ah now i'm glad you ask me that it be one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me that's say something you see only one who want to find the stone—find it but not use it—would be able to get it otherwise they'd just see themselves make gold or drink elixir of life my brain surprise even me sometimes now enough question i suggest you make a start on these sweets ah bettie bott's every flavor bean i be unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then i'm afraid i've rather lose my like for them—but i think i'll be safe with a nice toffee don't you he smile and pop the golden-brown bean into his mouth then he choke and say alas ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse be a nice woman but very strict just five minutes harry plead absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in well of course that be the headmaster quite different you need rest i be rest look lie down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she say but five minutes only and she let ron and

stone's go say ron finally flamel's just go to die that's what i say but dumbledore think that—what be it?—'to the well-organized mind death be but the next great adventure i always say he be off his

to help i don't think it be an accident he let me find out how the mirror work it's almost like he think i have the right to face voldemort if i could yeah dumbledore's off his rocker all right say

already full it be deck out in the slytherin color of green and silver to celebrate slytherin's win the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner show the slytherin serpent cover the wall behind the high table when harry walk in there be a sudden hush and then everybody start talk loudly at once he slip into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and try to ignore the fact that people be stand up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrive moments later the babble die away another year go dumbledore say cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old man's wheeze waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it have be hopefully your head be all a little fuller than they be you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year start now as i understand it the house cup here need award and the point stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve point in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fifty-two ravenclaw have four hundred and twenty-six and slytherin four hundred and seventytwo a storm of cheer and stamp break out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy bang his goblet on the table it be a sicken sight yes yes well do slytherin say dumbledore however recent events must be take into account the room go very still the slytherins smile fade a little ahem say dumbledore i have a few last-minute point to dish out let me see yes first—to mr ronald weasley ron go purple in the face he look like a radish with a bad sunburn for the best-played game of chess hogwarts have see in many years i award gryffindor house fifty point gryffindor cheer nearly raise the bewitch ceiling the star overhead seem to quiver percy could be hear tell the other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother get past mcgonagall's giant chess set at last there be silence again second—to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty point hermione bury her face in her arm harry strongly suspect she have burst into tear gryffindors up and down the table be beside themselves—they be a hundred point up third—to mr harry potter say dumbledore the room go deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty point the din be deafen those who could add up while yell themselves hoarse know that gryffindor now have four hundred and seventy-two points—exactly the same as slytherin they have tie for the house cup—if only dumbledore have give harry just one more point dumbledore raise his hand the room gradually fell silent there be all kinds of courage say dumbledore smile it take a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends i therefore award ten point to mr neville longbottom someone stand outside the great hall might well have think some sort of explosion have take place so loud be the noise that erupt from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stand up to yell and cheer as neville white with shock disappear under a pile of people hug him he have never win so much as a point for gryffindor before harry still cheer nudge ron in the rib and point at malfoy who couldn't have look more stun and horrify if he'd just have the body-bind curse put on him which mean dumbledore call over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff be celebrate the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decoration he clap his hand in an instant the green hang become scarlet and the silver become gold the huge slytherin serpent vanish and a tower gryffindor lion take its place snape be shake professor mcgonagall's hand with a horrible force smile he catch harry's eye and harry know at once that snape's feel toward him hadn't change one jot this didn't worry harry it seem as though life would be back to normal next year or as normal as it ever be at hogwarts it be the best even of
